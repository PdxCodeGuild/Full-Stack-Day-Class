## Advanced Problem Solving
Please read [this](/notes/problem-solving-adv.md).

## Practice Order of Operations
What does this print out?
```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
d = 'p-'
print('apple-orange'[x[x[x[0]]]:9].split(d[x[1]-3])[min(x)][1:x[2]])
```

## Class Design
Remember, a class is just a grouping of some variables, with labels, to represent a complex object.

Think about what fields are necessary to represent the essence of an object.
Not just any data that is cursorily related to the object.

For type methods, you need to _already have_ an instance of the class.
This means functions that find an instance or make a new instance _should not_ be type methods.

Bad:
```python
class AddressBookEntry:
    def find_phone_for(self, name):
        ...

    def build_entry_from_prompt(self, name):
        ...
```

Good:
```python
class AddressBookEntry:
    ...

def find_phone_for(name, phonebook):
    ...

def build_entry_from_prompt(name):
    ...
```
