# Hot Tips: 2016-04-22
## Only Vertical Margins Collapse
I mis-spoke before.

As a tip, if you want equal spacing between all inner elements and their container, set the padding of the container and the margin of the inner elements to be half the spacing.

## Explicit Width and Height Sizes Just Content Box
Setting `width` or `height` just sizes the **content box**, which does _not_ include the padding or the border.
That might mean you have to do more math in some instances to get the visual height of objects to be correct.

You can read up on the [box sizing property](https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/) as a way to change this.
