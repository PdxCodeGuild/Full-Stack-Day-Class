# Hot Tips: 2016-05-16

## Route Guidelines

Always start with `^` and end with `$`.

```py
url(r'^form$', views.render_form, name='form')
url(r'^form/submit$', views.render_form_ack, name='ack')
```

If you forget the `$`, someone going to `/form/blah` will go to the first view.

Only end with a `/` if there's further hierarchy.

Slashes are not exactly optional.
By default, Django [appends](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/settings/#append-slash) them if they're missing, but your links and form actions and AJAX paths should match exactly.

If you forget them, you'll see 304 redirects in your history.

## Use Branches

Don't submit your non-working code for checked practice.
How do I know if it's working?

I totally want you to keep practicing the advanced versions of problems, though!
Use _branches_ to isolate your changes and commit them to master once you've finished.

Or, if you just want a playground, make blank test projects.

## Constant Case

Module-level variables that don't change value should be in `CONSTANT_CASE`.
This doesn't apply to function-level vars.

`spell_check.py`

```py
CORRECT_SPELLINGS = ['potato', 'their']

def check_spelling(word):
    ...
```

## Isolate Logic in Logic

Your logic functions should just have the isolated core of your problem.
They should _not contain_ things that deal with requests or templates directly in them.

## Use JS Linter

Turn it on!
Even before you're cleaning up your projects.

It will teach you good habits so you don't have to learn them later.
