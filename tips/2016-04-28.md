## Script at End of Body
Do this so that your page displays faster.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- The whole page. -->

        <script src="source.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Use Function Definitions
There's actually two ways to define a function: function expressions and function definitions.
```js
var addThree = function (x) {
    return x + 3;
};  // ;
function addTwo(x) {
    return x + 2;
}  // None
```

I taught you the expression way, but reading up, _use the definition way_.
It let's you debug easier and write recursive functions.

There are still a few instances where you'll use a function expression and assign it to a var, but we'll learn about them later.
I thought it would be easiest to only deal with one way to make functions, but I picked the wrong way.
