# Hot Tips: 2014-04-04
## Avoid Extraneous Parens and Spaces
Actually, let's just go over [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) together.

## Read the Naming Rules Again
Please review [them](naming.md) on your own time.

## Keep "Tuples" Together
Avoid splitting lists of pairs, parallel processing each, then zipping them back up.
Maybe not those exact commands, but that in principle.

Avoid:
```python
product_to_price = {'apple': 0.99, 'pear': 1.50}
products_by_price = sorted(products_by_price.keys(), key=product_to_price.get)
prices = sorted(product_to_price.values())

max_item = (products_by_price[-1], prices[-1])
```

Better:
```python
product_to_price = {'apple': 0.99, 'pear': 1.50}
def get_price(pair):
    product, price = pair
    return price
max_item = max(product_to_price.items(), key=get_price)
```

## Don't Modify For Loop Variables
Totally the opposite advice of _always modify while loop variables_.
While loops require you to modify them to terminate.
For loops have very unexpected behavior if you modify them sometimes.
Instead use a comprehension / `list.append` to create a new copy.

This might work, but is actually undefined behavior.
Bad:
```python
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for num in nums:
    if not is_even(num):
        nums.remove(num)
```

Better:
```python
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
even_nums = []
for num in nums:
    if is_even(num):
        even_nums.append(num)
```

Best:
```python
def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
even_nums = [num if not is_even(num) else num * 2 for num in nums]
```

## If Expressions
There is a mini version of an if statement that returns a value.
It doesn't support `elif` branches, but you can nest them.

Statement version:
```python
if is_raining:
    shoes = 'boots'
else:
    shoes = 'sandals'
```

Expression version:
```python
shoes = 'boots' if is_raining else 'sandals'
```

This expression is like any other!
You can put it anywhere that needs a value.
