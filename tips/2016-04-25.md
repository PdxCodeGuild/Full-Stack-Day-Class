# Hot Tips: 2016-04-25
## Proper Hierarchy
Read my new notes on [hierarchy in HTML](../notes/htmlhierarchy.md) and using [hierarchy for layout](../notes/hierarchicallayout.md).

## Don't Use BR
Guideline: Don't use it except in poetry.

They often are a signal that you actually have more structure in your HTML.

Instead of:
```html
<div class="card">
    <p>
        Title 1998<br>
        Watercolor on Canvas<br>
        A beautiful piece.
    </p>
</div>
```

```html
<div class="card">
    <h3>Title <span class="year">(1998)</span></h3>
    <p class="medium">Watercolor on Canvas</p>
    <div class="description">
        <p>A beautiful piece.</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Height 100% is Meaningless
It doesn't have a well-defined meaning, so produces strange things.
Explicitly build up the height you want from well defined child heights.

## Width 100% is often Meaningless
Adding `width: 100%` on a block element is unnecessary.
They all default to full width.

You might think you need it if the parent is a flexbox, but then you're using the flexbox to do row and column layout, which isn't taking advantage of hierarchy.

## Text-Only-Containing Elements
Certain elements can only contain inline elements.
`p` is one of them.
Paragraph elements are for structure.

You can't do
```html
<p>
    Here's a list!
    <ul>
        <li>Item.</li>
    </ul>
    More stuff.
</p>
```

You have to
```html
<p>
    Here's a list!
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Item.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    More stuff.
</p>
```

The former will be parsed by the browser, but it won't be structured like you'd hope...
So see the next tip.

## Web Inspector Shows Actual Hierarchy
Use the hierarchy shown in the web inspector to see how your HTML actually got parsed.
Double check that your HTML is actually structured as you think it is.
