# Hot Tips: 2016-04-08
## Debug Your Constructor
One of your inputs to every class method is `self`.
That's an instance of the class that was prepared via magic init.
That means sometimes your bug comes from _setting up_ the object and not from the function you're working on.

In general, this is an example of "check your inputs"!
Which is just as important as checking your outputs.

In this example `get_area_code` doesn't work.
But not because the function is wrong!
```python
class AddressBookEntry:
    def __init__(self, name, number):
        self.name = name
        self.number = number

    def get_area_code(self):
        return self.number[:3]

def main():
    me = AddressBookEntry('David', 5075559895)
    print(me.get_area_code())

main()
```

It's because the object was constructed incorrectly!
Add in some debug print statements to make sure the type is correct.
```python
class AddressBookEntry:
    def __init__(self, name, number):
        print(type(number))
        self.name = name
        self.number = number

    def get_area_code(self):
        print(self.number)
        return self.number[:3]

def main():
    me = AddressBookEntry('David', 5075559895)
    print(me.get_area_code())

main()
```

Or, if you want to be super fancy, actually raise an error so the stack trace will show you where you're building the bad instance.
```python
class AddressBookEntry:
    def __init__(self, name, number):
        if type(number) != str:
            raise TypeError()
        self.name = name
        self.number = number

    def get_area_code(self):
        return self.number[:3]

def main():
    me = AddressBookEntry('David', 5075559895)
    print(me.get_area_code())

main()
```

## Use Main, Really
Sorry I keep forgetting in our demo code.
Define a `main()` function at the bottom where all of the action happens, then immediately call it.

**Do this. Right now.**
Go change the code at the bottom of the project you're working on.

Classes are super confusing because there are now more context variables can exist in.
Prevent yourself from thinking you understand how classes work because you've been abusing function scope.

## Open Atom for Commit Message
[This web page](https://help.github.com/articles/associating-text-editors-with-git/) explains how to do it.

Basically
```bash
git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
```

## Data Transformation Summary
I've written up [high-level data operations](/notes/highleveldataops.md).
Take a look at them.

## Hard-Code Debug Values / Work on Input Last
Even though getting user input is the first step of a real program, _don't work on it first_.

1. Work on making your models first.
1. Then work on transformation.
1. Then work on everything else.

If you have to type in the same input every time, you're slowing yourself down.
While debugging, you change your code _way more_ than you change your input.
```python
votes = []
take_votes = True
while take_votes:
    vote_name = input('Who are you voting for? ')
    if vote_name != 'done':
        votes.append(vote_name)
    else:
        take_votes = False

winner = calc_winner(votes)
```

Instead, work on the logic first.
Iterate on that code quickly, then only introduce your slow fingers when necessary.
```python
winner = calc_winner(['Hillary', 'Bernie', 'Bernie'])

my_hand = Hand([Card('K', 'Diamonds')])
```

If you've already written some input code, comment it out just for now!
