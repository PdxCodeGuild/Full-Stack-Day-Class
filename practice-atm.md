# Practice: ATM
Write a program that functions as a simple ATM.

Provide a simple interface to have someone:
* Login to their account by number or open a new account.
* Deposit to the account.
* Check if enough funds for a withdrawal.
* Withdraw an allowed amount.
* Calculate 0.5% interest on the account.

Implement accounts as classes.
