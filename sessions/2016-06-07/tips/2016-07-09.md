## Dimensional Analysis

Fancy name, easy problem solving technique.
Make sure your _units_ at each step make sense.

## Retry Interfaces

Some of you are super pumped about making nice CLIs.
Often those involve retrying input.
Here is the pattern I like to use to do that.

Initialize the variable to an _impossible and incorrect value_.
Then loop until correct.

```py
age = -1
while age < 0:
    print('What is your age?')
    age = int(input())
```

## Naming

Whoops, I forgot to go over my [variable naming notes](/notes/naming-variables-basic.md).

## Quotes

I suggest strings use single quotes `''`.
If your string contains an apostrophe, you can use double quotes or escape the apostrophe with a backslash `\`.

```py
'can\'t'
"can't"
```

## Line Continuations

Read up on [my notes](/notes/py-continuations.md).
