## Independence Expectations

You can't know everything.
I want you to work towards being independent as the class has continued.
But independent does not mean isolated.

I do not expect you to know how to solve things we haven't covered in the course.
I do expect you to know how to look up and solve problems closely related to what we covered.

You should still be asking me questions!
That's why you're in this course and not studying for free in your closet.
Take advantage of my expertise.
If you bang your head against something for 30 minutes, stop.
Come talk to me.

## Less Tangible Capstone Requirements

Don't forget your capstone should have well named functions and variables, docstrings, PEP-8 formatting, and use functions as structure to break down problems.
Turn on your linter.

## Code Review Next Week

As a professional developer your code is read far more than it is written.
Write your capstone with this in mind.

To help out with this I'll be pairing people up and having folks read through and understand each other's code.
Like we did on some other practice problems.

No need for your project to be done or functional!
Just to get someone else's feedback on your structures.
