## Only Vertical Margins Collapse
Only vertical margins collapse so the biggest margin specifies the spacing.
Horizontal margins just sum together.

If you want equal spacing between a matrix of items in a container, you can specify the left/right container padding to be half the spacing, the left/right item margin to be half the spacing, and the top/bottom item margin to be the full spacing.

## Explicit Width and Height Sizes Just Content Box
Setting `width` or `height` just sizes the **content box**, which does _not_ include the padding or the border.
That might mean you have to do more math in some instances to get the visual height of objects to be correct.

You can read up on the [box sizing property](https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/) as a way to change this.
