## Don't Modify Loop List
If you see yourself modifying the collection you're `for`-looping over, stop.
It's almost always wrong.

Wrong:
```python
full_names = ['Rachel Raccoon', 'Joe Plumber']
for full_name in full_names:
  first_last = full_name.split()
  initials = first_last[0][0] + first_last[1][0]
  full_names.append(initials)  # MISTAKE!
```

Even better, use a list comprehension.
See below.

## Inside of Loop as function
Almost every time you use a `for` loop, you're performing the exact same thing on every item.
Break that "thing" out into it's own function that takes a single item as input and the transform as output.
Way easier to test.

Fine:
```python
def slice_initials_list_from_full_names(full_names):
  initials_list = []
  for full_name in full_names:
    first_last = full_name.split()
    initials = first_last[0][0] + first_last[1][0]
    initials_list.append(initials)
  return initials_list

slice_initials_list_from_full_names(['Rachel Raccoon', 'Joe Plumber'])
```

Better:
```python
def slice_initials_from_full_name(full_name):
  first_last = full_name.split()
  return first_last[0][0] + first_last[1][0]

def slice_initials_list_from_full_names(full_names):
  initials_list = []
  for full_name in full_names:
    initials = slice_initials_from_full_name(full_name)
    initials_list.append(initials)
  return initials_list

slice_initials_list_from_full_names(['Rachel Raccoon', 'Joe Plumber'])
```

Even better, use a list comprehension.
See below.

## Use List Comprehensions
90% of the time you want to use a `for` loop, actually use a list comprehension.
Then you don't have to worry about whether you got the list adding stuff right.

Better:
```python
def slice_initials_from_full_name(full_name):
  first_last = full_name.split()
  return first_last[0][0] + first_last[1][0]

def slice_initials_list_from_full_names(full_names):
  initials_list = []
  for full_name in full_names:
    initials = slice_initials_from_full_name(full_name)
    initials_list.append(initials)
  return initials_list

slice_initials_list_from_full_names(['Rachel Raccoon', 'Joe Plumber'])
```

Best:
```python
def slice_initials_from_full_name(full_name):
  first_last = full_name.split()
  return first_last[0][0] + first_last[1][0]

def slice_initials_list_from_full_names(full_names):
  return [
    slice_initials_from_full_name(full_name)
    for full_name
    in full_names
  ]

slice_initials_list_from_full_names(['Rachel Raccoon', 'Joe Plumber'])
```
