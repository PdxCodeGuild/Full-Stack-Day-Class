# Hot Tips: 2016-05-20

## Conflicting Routes

Come up with distinct route prefixes when necessary.
Don't overload a prefix.

Realize routes are evaluated _in order_.

```py
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
    url(r'^base', views.base),  # If you forget a $, will "eat" longer paths.
    url(r'^base/(?P<named>.+)$', views.base_capture),  # Captures might "eat" longer paths.
    url(r'^base/wont_match$', views.base_wont_match),  # Will never match because of _both_ of above routes.
]
```

## Don't Commit DB / Do Commit Migrations

_Don't_ commit `db.sqlite3`.
It contains the actual instances of your models.
That's not part of your app's "code".

_Do_ commit `DJANGO_APP_ROOT/migrations` whenever it changes.
It stores the instructions for how to create and save all the different versions of your model instances.
This is an auto-generated part of your app's "code".

## For Models with Relations, Save Before Linking

If you had an Author and Book models that are in a many-to-many relation.

```py
from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.TextField()

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.TextField()
    authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author)
```

You can't do:

```py
herman_melville = Author(name='Herman Melville')
moby_dick = Book(title='Moby Dick', authors=[herman_melville])
herman_melville.save()
moby_dick.save()
```

You have to save parent instances before you make the link.

```py
herman_melville = Author(name='Herman Melville')
herman_melville.save()
moby_dick = Book(title='Moby Dick', authors=[herman_melville])
moby_dick.save()
```

Do this for `OneToOneField`s, `ForeignKey`s, or `ManyToManyField`s.

## Docstrings

Your capstone needs docstrings on all functions and modules to be properly documented.
Skim [PEP-257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for guidelines on docstrings.

## Flake8 and YAPF

I've found a linter and formatter that should make your code beautiful.
