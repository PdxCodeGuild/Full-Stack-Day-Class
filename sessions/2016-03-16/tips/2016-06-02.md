# Hot Tips: 2016-06-02

## Secrets

If you start to fiddle around with deployment, you need to hide your account keys.
**Do not commit passwords or keys in your Git repo.**

* AWS keys
* DB passwords
* SSH keys
* Auth tokens

Last week someone in the night class accidentally pushed their AWS keys to GitHub overnight.
**The next morning they had $1600 in charges on their account.**
There are bots that scrape GitHub for valid keys and use them as a bot net or Bitcoin mine or strange things like that.

Make a directory called `secrets` and put it in your Git ignore to prevent it from being added.
In development, read out of this dir.
Talk to me about techniques for giving keys to deployed production servers; often you don't need them.

## Linter Config in Capstone Repo

Turn on your linter.

If you haven't put `.flake8` ([download](/.flake8)) and `.eslintrc.js` ([download](/.eslintrc.js)) in your capstone repo root and committed them, do so.
Otherwise you won't have the proper configuration.

## Javascript Function Documentation

JS functions should also have "docstrings" called **JSDoc**.
They start with `/**` and end with `*/`.

Install the [Docblockr](https://atom.io/packages/docblockr) Atom package to make it easier to write them.
Type `/**` and press enter and it will fill out a template.

All you need to write is the same as a docstring, a short description.

```js

/**
 * Takes a number and returns it doubled.
 */
function double(x) {
    return x * 2;
}
```

## Testing

Don't worry about testing as a capstone requirement.
We didn't go over it in enough detail for me to grade on it.

I do encourage you to write up tests if you have the time and the wherewithal.
Test writing is an in-demand skill and you will be expected to learn it in the workplace.

## Development Jobs

I've written up some notes on [developement roles](/notes/dev-roles.md) and [types of companies that employ developers](/notes/dev-companies.md).
