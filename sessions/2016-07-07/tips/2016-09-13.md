## Capstone Feedback

On Thursday of each week, I'll be looking over your capstone repos and emailing you feedback.
It will be nowhere near as detailed as the practice problem feedback;
I will be giving mid to high-level feedback.

I will you know what requirements are complete, which need work, which seem lacking, and any other random ideas that come to mind.
I'll prioritize them so that they are actionable.

## Capstone Readme

On that note, please prepare a draft [capstone readme](/notes/capstone-readme.md) by then.
Just some quick notes on how I can run your app.
