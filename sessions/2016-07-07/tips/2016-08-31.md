# Hot Tips: 2016-08-31

## Demo Day Thursday / Tomorrow

There is another day class that ended during our session and they are having their [demo day](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pdx-code-guild-3rd-anniversary-party-tickets-27184728254) Thursday / tomorrow.
The afternoon will be spent watching their presentations.
I'll wander down there around 1:30 P.M.

## Globals in Doctests

Functions capture their own [globals and closures dict (see "user-defined functions")](https://docs.python.org/release/3.5.2/reference/datamodel.html) _upon definition_.
This is basically lexical scoping!
This means you can't dynamically change what variable a function is operating on at runtime.

So doctests have no way of changing that binding as it's formally read-only.
Doctests can (and do) only reset the [globals()](https://docs.python.org/release/3.5.2/library/functions.html#globals) environment of the doctest shell.

Try to write your code in a way that isolates interactions with globals so that you don't have to hit this problem when testing them.

## Functional Core, Stateful Shell

Check out my updated [Django debugging notes on tests](/notes/django-debugging.md#tests).
Try to structure your code to do this so you have the most confidence in most of your code.

Remember, the point is not to write tests for every single bit of high-level functionality, but instead to have enough overlapping tests that you can be pretty sure about correctness.

This function is hard to doctest correctly.

```py
_USERS = []


def add_new_user(name, email):
    new = User(name, email)
    _USERS.append(new)
```

But if it's split up into multiple parts, you can doctest each part and have a high confidence that the final function will work.

```py
_USERS = []


def _create_user(name, email):
    return User(name, email)


def _append_user(existing_users, new_user):
    return existing_users + [new_user]


def add_new_user(name, email):
    new_user = _create_user(name, email)
    _USERS = _append_user(_USERS, new_user)
```

Yes this example involves trivial operations (you'd basically be doctesting a constructor and list concat), but the concept is very useful!
