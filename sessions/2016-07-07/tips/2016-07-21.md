# Hot Tips: 2016-07-21

## Use Dictionary Setter Operator

If you want to set a single value in a dictionary, the most concise way is to use the setter operator.

```py
fruit_to_price = {'apple': 0.99, 'banana': 0.25}
fruit_to_price['banana'] = 0.50
fruit_to_price  #> {'apple': 0.99, 'banana': 0.5}
```

Using `dict.update()` is more verbose.

## Dictionary Keys Must be Unique

If you could possibly have duplicate keys and that makes sense, don't use a plain dictionary.

```py
d = {'a': 1, 'b': 1}
inv_d = {v: k for k, v in d.items()}
inv_d  #> {1: 'b'}
```

If you're doing this because you are searching for a value, make a list of pairs, then filter or search the pairs.

```py
d = {'a': 1, 'b': 1}
keys_with_val_1 = [k for k, v in d.items() if v == 1]
```

If your data truly has multiple values, then the values of the dict should be lists.

```py
d = {1: ['a', 'b']}
```

## Don't use Sets to Group

It might seem like a necessary step when grouping to get a set of all of the unique buckets first.

```py
marbles = ['red', 'blue', 'red']
unique_colors = set(marbles)
```

No need!
That's one part of the _implementation_ of grouping.
If you're implementing your own grouping, you're probably using a dict and dict keys are already required to be unique, so no need to worry about it up front!
If you use `groupby()` you don't even need to worry about that.

Use `groupby()`.

```py
from itertools import groupby

color_to_marbles = {
    key: list(values)
    for key, values
    in groupby(marbles)
}
```

## Keep Paired Data Together

This is a very high-level comment, but try to keep it in mind.

If you have a heterogeneous noun that contains a few fields that you need to cross-reference between often, don't break them apart!

If you break them apart into something "column first", then you have to ensure you can re-make the links between fields, which is hard to debug that you're doing right.

There's not just one exact set of functions that let you know you're doing it, but try to be aware.
**Avoid.**

```py
contact_infos = [('David', '507-555-9895'), ('Helen', '507-555-2333')]
names = [name for name, _ in contact_infos]
phone_number = [phone for _, phone in contact_infos]
i = phone_number.index('507-555-9895')
name[i]  #> 'David'
```

```py
def name_for_phone(find_phone, contact_infos):
    for name, phone in contact_infos:
        if phone == find_phone:
            return name
```

```py
phone_to_contact = {phone: (name, phone) for name, phone in contact_infos}
phone_to_contact[find_phone]
```

## Embrace Exceptions

Avoid having your step functions properly handle malformed input and silently return valid data.

```py
def convert_str_to_int(s):
    """Converts a string of an int to an int.

    >>> convert_str_to_int(5)
    5
    """
    if s.isnumeric():
        return int(s)
    else:
        return 0
```

The contract of this function implies that the input will be a string of an integer.
If you're calling this function with strings, then that's a bug!
You should have your code yell at you when there are bugs, rather than just corrupting the output data.

## Doctesting Complex Objects

You can put any Python expression on the `>>>` line.
And if you want you can only check part of a function's return value.

```py
def return_something_complex():
    """
    >>> return_something_complex()['apple']
    15
    >>> return_something_complex()['banana']
    2
    """
    return ...
```

I suggest not doing this, though, since you want to check if the whole return value is right!

## Put Top-Level Functions With Class

I would like you to start thinking about moving your top-level modification functions into the different modules.
Put them in the module that most closely relates to the class.
Or if it spans lots of classes, keep it in main.

I'm _not_ suggesting you put them _inside_ the class.
Just in the same module as the class.

E.g. put `collect_emails()` in the `roster` module.

```py
class User:
    ...

def send_email(user):
    ...
```
