# Hot Tips: 2016-07-19

## Style

I'm also going to be anal about style.
There is a pretty unambiguous style guide in [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

If PyCharm gives you a warning about it, you must fix it.
That makes it easy to do right and no professional code does not follow the style guide.
From this point forward, I'm going to refuse to look at checked problems until they conform to PEP-8.

There are open source projects that don't even respond to contributions that don't follow the style guide.
Think about style as flexible as the syntax of the language; there is leeway, but there are also requirements.

## Docstrings

I'm going to be anal about docstrings.
There is unambiguous guidance about spacing in [PEP-257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).
It's easy to do right and no professional code does not follow a style guide.

If you want to have the optional the argument and return value annotations `:param:` and `:return:` you can, but you must fill them out properly if they are there.

From this point forward, I'm going to refuse to look at checked problems until they conform to PEP-257.

```py
def small_function():
    """Does something simple."""
    ...

def function():
    """This is a summary of what the function does.

    Here is optional detailed information.

    >>> run_doctest()
    answer
    >>> more_doctest()
    answer
    """
    ...

def param_function(x, y):
    r"""This is a summary of what the function does.

    >>> run_doctest('\n')
    answer

    :param x: user's name as a string
    :param y: something else
    :return: the user's favorite color
    """
    ...
```

## Doctests

Finally, I'm going to be anal about doctests.

From this point forward, I'm going to refuse to look at checked problems that don't have appropriate doctest coverage.

I understand that not all functions are easily testable (e.g. input functions)!
That's fine.
Don't test those.
But you can test almost everything else.

Testing and the code are synergistic.
**If code is hard to test, it's not good code.**
Often times that means the way the problem is being broken up isn't the best.

```py
'\n\nsomething'
```

## Clean Git Status

You should generally have a clean `git status` with little red.
Don't keep untracked files around.

Commit or ignore.

## Git "Cheat Sheet"

Someone has made an [awesome visualization](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html) of how all the Git commands move data between the different parts.

## Data Operations Overview

I've cleaned up my [notes on data transformations](/notes/problem-solving-data-transformations.md) and we should go over it again.
Use those code examples!
