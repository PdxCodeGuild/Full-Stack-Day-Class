# Hot Tips: 2016-07-26

## Itemgetter and Attrgetter

Tired of writing tiny functions for `max()` and `sorted()` and `group_by()` that just pick out an index?
Turns out the `operators` module has a function [itemgetter()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.itemgetter) that will _make that function_.

So instead of writing out that simple function by hand.

```py
name_age_pairs = [('David', 40), ('Helen', 15)]

def get_age(name_age):
    """Return the age of a name, age pair.

    >>> get_age(('David', 40))
    40
    """
    return name_age[1]

youngest_name_age = min(name_age_pairs, key=get_age)
```

You can use `itemgetter(index)` which returns a _function_ that does that.

```py
from operators import itemgetter

name_age_pairs = [('David', 35), ('Helen', 15)]
get_age = itemgetter(1)
youngest_name_age = min(name_age_pairs, key=get_age)
```

Similarly there is [attrgetter()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.attrgetter) for dot operator `.` attribute access.
`attrgetter(name_str)` returns a _function_ that gets that attribtue.

```py
from operators import attrgetter

class NameAge:
    """Class that pairs a name and an age."""

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

name_ages = [NameAge('David', 35), NameAge('Helen', 15)]
youngest_name_age = min(name_age_pairs, key=attrgetter('age'))
```

## Quality before Quantity

When turning in your practice problems, I'd like all of you to focus on turning in a _quality_ assignment before turning in one that tackles all of the advanced versions.
I think it is more important and challenging to practice the structural lessons of the course at this point rather than solve the advanced versions of the problem.

I'm not saying don't do them!
But before you start on them, run down the checklist of things that I'm looking at:

* Style
* Naming
* Explicit steps with input and output
* Docstrings
* Doctests
* Delegating to data transformations (e.g. list comprehensions, group by)
* Using structured data (e.g. namedtuples, classes)

## "Private" Functions

You are welcome to add as many extra functions as you need to a class or module as part of breaking a problem down.
If you prefix them with underscore `_`, then that means they shouldn't be used outside.
You can use all of the breaking-problems-down-into-functions practice that we've been using the whole class.

```py
class PhoneNumber:
    """Class which stores a normalized phone number.

    Instantiate with a string containing the phone number in any format.
    """

    def __init__(self, num_str):
        self.num_str = num_str

    def get_area_code(self):
        """Return the area code of the phone number.

        >>> pn = PhoneNumber('503-555-1234')
        >>> pn.get_area_code()
        503
        """
        norm_num = _normalize_non_numbers(self.num_str)
        return norm_num[:4]


def _normalize_non_numbers(in_num_str):
    """Normalize a phone number.

    >>> _normalize_non_numbers('503-555-9895')
    '5035559895'
    """
    return in_num_str.replace('-', '')
```

I encourage you to put your helper step functions at a module level (like above) if they don't need the full instance of the class.
Consider testing the alternative.

```py
class PhoneNumber:
    ...

    def _normalize_non_numbers(self, in_num_str):
        """Normalize a phone number.

        >>> pn = PhoneNumber('503-555-9895')
        >>> pn._normalize_non_numbers('503-555-9895')
        '5035559895'
        """
        return in_num_str.replace('-', '')
```

Or a third option of not taking an explicit input argument.

```py
class PhoneNumber:
    ...

    def _normalize_non_numbers(self):
        """Normalize a phone number.

        >>> pn = PhoneNumber('503-555-9895')
        >>> pn._normalize_non_numbers()
        '5035559895'
        """
        return self.num_str.replace('-', '')
```

Both are more verbose to test.

## Import Star Considered Harmful

Avoid importing all names in a module.

```py
from itertools import *


l = product([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b'])
```

Are you sure you know all of the names in that module?
Are there unnecessary ones that will clash with the names in your file?
Are there ones that are close to names in your file that will confuse you or allow typos to work?

Avoid all of those possible issues.
Just import each name directly.
Or import the module and dot access at each use.

```py
import itertools


l = itertools.product([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b'])
```

## Code out Patterns

After you've finished a first pass over your problem's solution, try looking through your own code for patterns.
Then try getting the computer to write out that pattern.

It's really easy to make mistakes incrementing indices or using explicit names.

```py
l = ['apple', 'orange', 'pear', 'pineapple']
odd_l = [l[1], l[3]]
```

Instead

```py
odd_l = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]
odd_l = l[::2]
```

## PyCharm Local Imports

To get PyCharm to recognize local relative imports, you have to explicitly mark the directory you're in as a **source directory**.
Go to `Settings -> Project -> Project Structure`, select the directory you're currently editing a file in, and click the blue `Sources` button to mark it.
It's a toggle button, so you can use it to unmark.

PyCharm assumes that each "project" is a single application, not the collection of separate projects like your portfolio is, so you should probably unmark each directory, when you go onto working on another practice problem.
Although if the module names don't overlap, that won't be an issue.
