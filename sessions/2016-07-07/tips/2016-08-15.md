# Hot Tips: 2016-08-15

## TriMet API Bug

I added a comment to the [Bus Stop Finder](/practice/bus-stop-finder.md) saying how you need to use `dataType: 'json'`.

## Callbacks into Promises

I added [some notes on this](/notes/js-promises.md).

## OpenLayers

For the [Earthquake](/practice/earthquake.md) practice problem, please use [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org) for the JS mapping library.

I just had a total brain fart.
I've used OpenLayers before and wanted you to use that, but not GeoJS.
The documentation is much easier to understand.

I still think looking through the [quickstart](http://openlayers.org/en/latest/doc/quickstart.html) and [examples](http://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/) is a great way to get started quickly.
