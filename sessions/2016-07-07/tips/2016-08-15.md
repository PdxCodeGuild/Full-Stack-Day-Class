# Hot Tips: 2016-08-15

## TriMet API Bug

I added a comment to the [Bus Stop Finder](/practice/bus-stop-finder.md) saying how you need to use `dataType: 'json'`.

JSONP in a nutshell:
Instead of returning the requested data as JSON

```json
{"name": "David", "phone": "503-555-9895"}
```

The server returns JS which calls a given function with the data

```js
processContact({name: 'David', phone: '503-555-9895'});
```

So if the server responds with one, the code should be parsed and not run, but otherwise it should be run.
In order for jQuery to know what to do, you have to specify what you expect the response to be correctly.

## Callbacks into Promises

I added [some notes on this](/notes/js-promises.md).

## OpenLayers

For the [Earthquake](/practice/earthquake.md) practice problem, please use [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org) for the JS mapping library.

I just had a total brain fart.
I've used OpenLayers before and wanted you to use that, but not GeoJS.
The documentation is much easier to understand.

I still think looking through the [quickstart](http://openlayers.org/en/latest/doc/quickstart.html) and [examples](http://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/) is a great way to get started quickly.
