## Named Functions Need JSDocs

If a function has a name, give it a JSDoc.
Even if it's defined in an object literal or assignment.
Sorry the linter won't remind you of this, but I think it's important for all the usual reasons.

```js
var animalProto = {
  /**
   * Returns a string with the noise this animal makes.
   */
  speak: function() {
    return 'Says: ' + this.noise;
  }
};
/**
 * Returns a string representing sleeping.
 */
animalProto.sleep = function() {
  return 'Zzzz...';
};
```
