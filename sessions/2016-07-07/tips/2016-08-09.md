# Hot Tips

## Don't Worry About Using RegExp in Completer

I didn't think this through.
It's just kind of awkward.
If you've already got it working, that's fine.
Otherwise, we'll practice them later.

## Case Names

Let's settle on some names for each case.
I'll update my notes to be consistent.

*   `snake_case`

    * All lowercase, words separated by underscores `_`
    * Python variable and function names

*   `CONST_CASE`

    * All uppercase, words separated by underscores `_`
    * Python and JS constant names

*   `kebab-case`

    * All lowercase, words separated by dashes `-`
    * HTML class names and IDs

*   `WordCase`

    * Every word is capitalized
    * Python class names, JS constructor function names

*   `camelCase`

    * Every word is capitalized but the first word
    * JS variable and function names

## Web Inspector Console Newline

Pressing `shift-enter` inserts a new line in the console without submitting the statement.

## Padding Doesn't Collapse

Padding is the spacing the parent element asserts between it's border and children.
Padding does not "collapse" in either direction.

So, as a trick to get equidistant row layouts, if you apply half the desired "margin" as padding on the parent, then the other half as margin on the children, you'll get equal spacing.

```css
.row {
  padding: 5px;
}

.row > div {
  margin: 5px;
}
```

## Look at Demos and Solutions

I've heard from a few of you that looking at correct code is a super helpful way to learn patterns.
I've been working through and making better demos and solutions to submitted practice problems.
Please look them over in your own time!

* [Sidebar](/practice/solutions/sidebar)
* [Pyramid](/practice/solutions/pyramid)
* [Leet Speak](/demos/leet-speak.md)
* [Rarest](/practice/solutions/rarest/site.js)
* [Account](/demo/account.md)
* [Color](/practice/solutions/color/site.js)

I'm going to try to post solutions as you finish problems.
Please remind me if I fall behind.

## CSS Linter

I've found a [CSS linter](/notes/atom-css.md) that you should use.

## Useful Lodash Functions

* `forEach()`
* `map()`
* `filter()`
* `minBy()`
* `groupBy()`
* `countBy()`
* `pad()`
* `join()`
* `without()`
