# Hot Tips: 2016-08-23

## Use jQuery Setters over Append

Try to use an API in a way that requires the least amount of coordination.

Avoid:

```js
$('h1').empty();
$('h1').append('Hi!');
```

Instead:

```js
$('h1').text('Hi!');
```

## JS Names over "Tuples"

Avoid packing JS data into array "tuples".
Indices with different meanings are like magic numbers and make code harder to understand.

```js
function getContactInfo(name) {
  var allInfo = lookupAllInfo(name);
  return [allInfo.name, allInfo.phoneNumber];
}

function renderContactInfo(contactInfo) {
  // What does this show? Not sure...
  $('#contact').text(contactInfo[0] + ' - ' + contactInfo[1])
}
```

Instead, use named properties on objects.

```js
function getContactInfo(name) {
  var allInfo = lookupAllInfo(name);
  return {
    name: allInfo.name,
    phoneNumber: allInfo.phoneNumber
  };
}

function renderContactInfo(contactInfo) {
  // Much more direct as to what this shows.
  $('#contact').text(contactInfo.name + ' - ' + contactInfo.phoneNumber)
}
```

Python tuples were okay because we were unpacking them to named variables.

## Practice Async

Don't turn AJAX async off.
Have `$.ajax()` return a promise.
It's always a good idea to practice how to incorporate it into your program.

## Map vs forEach

Don't use `_.map` if you don't care about the results.
It implies that you're going to transform some data.

```js
_.map(numbers, function(number) {
  $('ul#nums').append($('<li></li>').text(number));
});
```

```py
[print(i) for i in range(10)]
```

`_.forEach` better describes what that is doing.

```js
_.forEach(numbers, function(number) {
  $('ul#nums').append($('<li></li>').text(number));
});
```

But in my mind, even better would be to break the process down into two steps, so you can check that each is working: transform then output.

```js
var numberLIs = _.map(numbers, function(number) {
  var li = $('<li></li>').
    text(number);
  return li;
});
$('ul#nums').append(numberLIs);
```

## Prototypes over Constructor Functions

Avoid:

```js
function Cat() {
  this.noise = 'meow';
  this.makeNoise = function() {
    return this.noise + '!';
  }
}
```

Instead:

```js
function Cat() {
  this.noise = 'meow';
}
Cat.prototype.makeNoise = function() {
  return this.noise + '!';
}
```

Many fewer objects in memory.

## Use Shortest Selectors

In general, the length of the selector is how expensive it is to evaluate.
If you have an ID on something, use that rather than structural selection.

## Use Closures Instead of Globals for Parameterized Callbacks

When you define a function, you save the surrounding scope in the definition.

```js
function makePrintNum(num) {
  return function() {
    console.log(num);
  }
}

var print5 = makePrintNum(5);
var print6 = makePrintNum(6);
print5();  //> Prints '5'.
print6();  //> Prints '6'.
```

This is a baby way for "code to write code".
It's totally great to make code that does this!

So if you need to setup a callback that is parameterized, do so right when you know the parameter so the data is saved in the closure and no global is needed.

```js
var names = ['David', 'Helen'];
var nameLIs = _.map(names, function(name) {
  var li = $('<li></li>').
    text(name)
    .on('click', function() {
      alert(name);
    });
  return li;
});
$('ul#names').append(nameLIs);
```

## Fewer Individual Problems

There are going to be fewer individual problems for you to work on at this point in the course.
Most of you have already gotten your capstone proposals checked off, so I want you to be working on them during any time between new material.
