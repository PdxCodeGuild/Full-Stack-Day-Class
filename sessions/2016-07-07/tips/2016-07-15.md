## Tutoring

Available after class.
Email [Chris](mailto:chris@pdxcodeguild.com) and [Katie](mailto:katie@pdxcodeguild.com) to schedule a time.

They sometimes can be busy!

## Checked vs Individual Problems

I am going to give every group time to finish their problem.

I am only grading checked problems.
Individual problems are for those who are ahead, for whatever reason, to work on while everyone else is catching up.

I post all due dates on our Syllabus.
Look at that.
I'll show it on the projector when I make something due.

## Group Goals

A.K.A. The journey, not the destination.

I don't really care that your program functions correctly.
I do care that it is structured well and everyone in the group contributes to and understands why it is structured well.

Each one of you should take it proudly upon yourself to make sure everyone is involved in that decision making and learning.

If you feel like someone is not contributing to the learning of others, let them (or me to let them) know.
Group work is a hard skill.
I want you all to feel safe practicing it and improving it in the classroom.

## Do Something

If you finish all of your checked and individual problems and don't have anything to do, let me know!

I can direct you towards your final capstone project or give you some tailored personal projects to use your time here.

## Breaks

Please take breaks during the day!
Take a walk outside.
Get a snack.
Even during group projects; if you need a break, it's fine to take it!
