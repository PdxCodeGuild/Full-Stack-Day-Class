## Sorry, itertools.groupby() is "Broken"

Eric is right, the `itertools.groupby()` function doesn't work as I expected right out of the box.
It requires that the input be effectively "sorted.""
So much for me reading the docs!

My apologies to directing you to use it without understanding it myself.

I still thing having a "group by" function that takes in a list and returns a dictionary of lists grouped by a key is a really great primitive problem solving operation.
I suggest you copy and paste [this group by function](/notes/grouping.md) into any problems that you need it and use that.
