## Be Weary of Identity

```py
>>> class Point:
...     def __init__(self, x, y):
...         self.x = x
...         self.y = y
...     def __repr__(self):
...         return 'Point({!r}, {!r})'.format(self.x, self.y)
...
>>> my_house = Point(1, 2)
>>> bros_house = my_house
>>> al_house = Point(3, 4)
>>> houses = [my_house, bros_house, al_house]
>>> houses
[Point(1, 2), Point(1, 2), Point(3, 4)]
>>> bros_house.y = 9
>>> bros_house
Point(1, 9)
>>> houses
[Point(1, 9), Point(1, 9), Point(3, 4)]
>>> my_house
Point(1, 9)
>>> x = [3]
>>> y = [x, x, x]
>>> y
[[3], [3], [3]]
>>> y[0].append(6)
>>> y
[[3, 6], [3, 6], [3, 6]]
>>> [x] * 3
[[3, 6], [3, 6], [3, 6]]
>>> [[]] * 5
[[], [], [], [], []]
>>> x = [[]] * 5
>>> x[0].append(4)
>>> x
[[4], [4], [4], [4], [4]]
>>> x = [[] for _ in range(5)
... ]
>>> x
[[], [], [], [], []]
>>> x[0].append(4)
>>> x
[[4], [], [], [], []]
>>> x[0] = x[0] + [4]
>>>
```

## Profile and RC

I got the

`~/.bash_profile` is read on all bash shell startups.
Environment setup goes in here.

```sh
if [[ $- == *i* ]]; then
    source ~/.bashrc
fi
```

`~/.bashrc` should be read on all interactive shell startups.
Stuff that modifies the prompt should go in here.

```bash
alias python='python3'
alias python2='\python'
alias pip='pip3'
alias pip2='\pip'
```

## Git Prompt

Let's get you a bash prompt that shows you your Git branch and status.
This will help in ensuring you're only committing what you want to the correct branch.

First, download [git-prompt.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh) into `~/.git-prompt.sh`.

Then put in your `.bashrc`:

```bash
source ~/.git-prompt.sh
GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1
GIT_PS1_SHOWCOLORHINTS=1
PROMPT_COMMAND='__git_ps1 "\u@\h:\w" "\\\$ "'
```

You can turn off colors or showing dirty files by removing the lines with those variables.

You can do tons of other [crazy prompt customization](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-customize-your-bash-prompt-on-a-linux-vps).
