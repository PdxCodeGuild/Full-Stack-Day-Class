# Hot Tips: 2016-07-13

## Use PyCharm For Development

I introduced Atom because it was less intimidating to get started with.
I don't want you to use it any more.
I want you to use PyCharm for all of your work.

My goal is for all of you to be comfortable with linters, debuggers, and running tests.
PyCharm ensures that all of those work for everyone; people were having problems getting Atom linters working.

The only linter setting I want you to change:

PyCharm > Preferences > Search for "docstrings" > Inspections > Check Missing or empty docstring.

If you have any issues getting any features of PyCharm working, let me know!
I'll help you out with them.

I'll edit my code in PyCharm as well, in addition to using `bpython` for playing around.

## Squash Linter Errors

Before you turn in code, make sure there are no linter errors and all your reasonable functions have doctests.
If you use PyCharm, this will be easy.

## If Expression

Read up on [my notes](/notes/py-if-expressions.md).
It's a slick way to inline most if statements.

Also remember you can make functions!

## Don't Debate, Investigate

Not sure if you can do a list comprehension over a string?
Don't know what `enumerate()` gives you?
Not sure how the if expressions work?

One person thinks a for loop will never work?
One person thinks `zip()` can't work on sets?

Don't guess.
Know!

**Use bpython.** (Or just `python`).
Please, try out stuff!
The computer will let you know.

```py
>>> s = 'hi'
>>> [l for l in s]
['h', 'i']
```

## Git Commit Messages

What should you put in Git commit messages?

What does Git keep track of for you?

* Timestamp of change.
* Files and lines changed.
* Who you are.
* Branch / feature you're working on (to some degree).

No need to talk about any of those things in your commit message.

The most common use case is someone (and not you, or a much older you) will be looking through Git history and trying to find which commits introduced bugs.

Thus, give a high-level semantic description of your change.

* `Fixes exception when no previous student groups.`
* `Fixes spelling in docstring.`
* `Adds wrap digits step.`

## Print in Doctests

Doctests will also test any `print` calls in the function.
The testing framework adds together any printed output and return values.
Return values are always _literals_, printed output is bare words.

This doctest will fail.

```py
def make_name():
    """Returns the super hard to remember name.

    >>> make_name()
    'David'
    """
    print('David')
    return 'David'
```

This will pass.

```py
def make_name():
    """Returns the super hard to remember name.

    >>> make_name()
    David
    'David'
    """
    print('David')
    return 'David'
```

This also means it's possible to test your output functions.

```py
def print_title(title):
    """Print out the title all fancy.

    >>> print_title('Final')
    ==Final==
    """
    print(title.center(len(title) + 4, '='))
```

## Python 3 Aliases

Who still can't run `python -V` and have Python 3 run?

Turns out you need to put aliases in `.profile` as opposed to `.bashrc`.

## Test Running

Are running your doctests in PyCharm hanging?
I forgot to tell you about [gating your main call](/notes/py-functions-main.md#gatedmain).
Do that.
