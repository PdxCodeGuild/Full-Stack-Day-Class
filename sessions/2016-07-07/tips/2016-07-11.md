# Hot Tips: 2016-07-11

## Selective Standup

We're not going to do standup unless we're in the middle of a multi-day project.
Otherwise it's a little boring.

## Implement Practice Feedback

I will always give you a few points of feedback on your checked practice problems.
Even if the solution is satisfactory.
Implement that feedback as practice writing "good code".

If I ask you to submit a revision of a practice problem, please submit it under the same filename.

## Submit under Requested Filename

I am only going to look at the solution you submit under the filename given at the top of the problem writeup.
This is because I don't know which of any other versions you might have fully completed, and I don't want to grade half-baked code.

I totally want to grade advanced versions of your problems, though, so save them under that original name.
But only once you're fully complete!

## Names: Really

Really focus on them.
Read my [name notes](/notes/naming-variables-basic.md)

Context can shorten name.
If the whole point of this program is to calculate wall painting costs, maybe we don't need to mention `wall_cost`, `cost` will do.

## Imports at Top

Only import at the top of a Python file, even if you only use the functionality in a certain section.
This makes it easier to find circular imports.

## Constant Case

Write out unchanging variables in `CONSTANT_CASE`.
Is reserved for true constants.
Not just variables that are "setup".

## Avoid Magic Numbers

Avoid **magic numbers** in your code that do the right thing, but require the reader of the code to know what they are to understand it.

In this case, I might not know why `5280` produces the correct answer.

```py
miles_ran = 99
print('Feet that I ran:', miles_ran * 5280)
```

Instead, store that magic number in a named constant and that will explain why it works without any more comments.

```py
FEET_PER_MILE = 5280
miles_ran = 99
print('Feet that I ran:', miles_ran * FEET_PER_MILE)
```

## Avoid Newline Literals in Print

Let's say you're printing out a table of our favorite fruits.

```
===Fruits===
Orange
```

You could do this in one print call.
But it can be hard to see what the resulting output structure will be.

```py
print('===Fruits===\n' + fav_fruit)
```

I suggest taking advantage of the fact that `print` puts a newline after each call so that the function calls mirror the output format.
Then when you read the code, you immediately know what it's going to look like.

```py
print('===Fruits===')
print(fav_fruit)
```

## Don't Unnecessarily Initialize Variables

Python does not require you to declare a type or initial value for a variable before you start using it.

```py
total_cost = 0
total_cost = rice_cost + beans_cost
```

Just assign a variable to the value you need.

```py
total_cost = rice_cost + beans_cost
```

The exception to this is when your recipe actually requires an initial value.
That's fine!

```py
total_cost = 0
for cost in costs:
    total_cost += cost
```

## Avoid Step-Wise Variable Updates

Sometimes you might want to incrementally update a "working value" in a few separate steps.

```py
wall_area_sq_ft = 100.0
wall_area_sq_ft = wall_area_sq_ft * coats
gallons = wall_area_sq_ft / SQ_FT_PER_GALLON
```

You're storing _totally separate_ values in a variable with the same name.
If the value keeps changing, should it be given the same name?
I say no.

Instead, make as many variables as you need to describe the differences in interpretation between the values.

```py
physical_wall_area_sq_ft = 100.0
painted_wall_area_sq_ft = physical_wall_area_sq_ft * coats
gallons = painted_wall_area_sq_ft / SQ_FT_PER_GALLON
```

## Use Elif When Disjoint

If you're branching on a few totally separate options, avoid using just `if` blocks.

```py
if card == 'A':
    points = 1
if card == 'J':
    points = 10
```

Instead, tell the reader of the code that the options will never happen at the same time.
And the code will run faster, too.

```py
if card == 'A':
    points = 1
elif card == 'J':
    points = 10
```

## Avoid Print before Output Section

It's a good habit to have all of your print calls happen at the end of the program in your output section.
Otherwise you have to play _reverse computer_ and figure out what print calls happens when and what the state of all of the variables were at that time.
That's hard!

If you put all the print statements at the end, it's obvious what values will be printed out and how they all relate to each other.

Ignore this advice when [print debugging](/notes/debugging-basic.md).
