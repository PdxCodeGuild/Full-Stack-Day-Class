## YAPF

[YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf) is a Python auto-formatter.
In goes badly-formatted Python code, out comes compact PEP-8 code.

First install it globally.

```bash
pip install yapf
```

Then you have access to the command line tool `yapf`.

You can setup PyCharm to pipe a working file through it.
Go to `Settings -> Tools -> External Tools`, then press the add plus `+`.
Use the following config settings.

* Name: `YAPF`
* Options: Only "Synchronize files after execution"
* Program: `yapf`
* Parameters: `-i $FilePath$`

You'll now have access to YAPF for the open file under `Tools -> External Tools -> YAPF`.
You can add a keyword shortcut to run it from settings also.
