# Hot Tips: 2016-09-02

## Django Components

I've tried to clarify [my notes on the structure of components](/notes/django-components.md) in a Django app.

## Holiday Monday

Don't come in on Monday!
It's labor day!

## Django Model Doctests

I now have [some notes](/notes/django-init.md#5-connect-doctests) for running doctests that use models.

1. Install `pytest` and `pytest-django` in your virtualenv
1. Add [pytest.ini](/notes/django-init.md#5-connect-doctests)
1. Add [DJANGO_APP_NAME/conftest.py](/demos/example_conftest.py)
1. Run them in PyCharm by adding a "Python tests -> py.test" run configuration and selecting your Django application root as the "target"

## Due Dates

Flutter is due on Wednesday 2016-09-07.
Please write doctests for everything and properly use the model-logic-view separation we discussed today.

I'm going to look at Jokes on Tuesday 2016-09-06.
You should already have doctests for most of those functions since they don't use the DB (remember my hint about breaking out a functional core).
No need to go back through that and re-do model-logic-view separation, but I encourage you to.

Tuesday afternoon we'll go on to the last technical lesson with a practice problem: AJAX.
