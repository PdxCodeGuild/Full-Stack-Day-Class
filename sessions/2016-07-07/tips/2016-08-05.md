# Hot Tips: 2016-08-05

## HTML Linter

Install [linter-htmlhint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-htmlhint).
No config necessary.
It'll help you notice when you're not closing tags, etc.

## Web Inspector HTML Editing

You can double click on the parsed HTML and edit it!
Then see what that produces.

That syntax highlighted HTML is always the syntacticly correct representation of what the browser parsed out of your HTML.
Use differences in this to see what your possibly-malformed HTML is being parsed as.

A common subtle mistake is putting block elements in those that only accept inline.

```html
<p>I love this list:
  <ul>
    <li>Apple</li>
    <li>Orange</li>
  </ul>
</p>
```

That ends up being parsed as:

```html
<p>I love this list:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Orange</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
```

## Web Inspector CSS Invalid Rules

If you see a little yellow warning triangle next to a crossed out CSS rule, mouse-over it to see why that rule isn't being parsed correctly.

Perhaps the property name was misspelled, perhaps the units aren't right.

Also, try out using the checkboxes to see what toggling a rule does.
Also you can add rules on the fly to see things!

## Check Pull Request Diffs

When you're turning in a problem, please check the Pull Request diff.
Make sure it is the version of the code you expect and doesn't have extraneous files.
This will also help you not forget to make a PR.

## Widths Down, Heights Up

Specify width on parent containers first.
Specify height on child containers first.

This is so your layouts will work with the standard flow algorithm and won't have conflicting values set.

This will make complex layout problems much easier!
Practice it now.

## Occam's Razor CSS Selectors

Use the least complex selector to select the desired elements.
Longer selectors are slower to render and also make the page unnecessarily inflexible.
Err on the side of generality until you don't need it; specifically because generality is shorter.

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1 class="green">Green!</h1>
    </header>
  </body>
</html>
```

Avoid:

```css
html > body > header > h1 {
  font-size: 50px;
}

html > body > header > h1.green {
  color: green;
}
```

Instead:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 50px;
}

.green {
  color: green;
}
```

Also, if you're creating and applying classes that mirror HTML structure, instead just select on structure.

Avoid:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Page Title</h1>
    </header>
    <article>
      <header class="article-header">
        <h2>Article Title</h2>
      </header>
    </article>
    <article>
      <header class="article-header">
        <h2>Article Title</h2>
      </header>
    </article>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css
.article-header {
  color: darkgrey;
}
```

Instead:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Page Title</h1>
    </header>
    <article>
      <header>
        <h2>Article Title</h2>
      </header>
    </article>
    <article>
      <header>
        <h2>Article Title</h2>
      </header>
    </article>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css
article > header {
  color: darkgrey;
}
```

## Semicolons

Semicolons go after expressions (things that have value), var statements, and one word statements (e.g. `return`).
There are actually [more nuanced rules](http://dailyjs.com/2012/04/18/640-semicolons/).

```js
// Yes: Expressions
dog.bark();

// Yes: Var
var x = 5;
var contactInfo = {
  name: 'David',
  phone: '503-555-1234'
// Even var that ends with a brace for an object!
};

// No: Definitions
function addTwo(y) {
  // Yes: Return
  return y + 2;
}

// Yes: Var!
var addTwo = function(y) {
  return y + 2;
};

// No: Blocks
if (x > 10 && x < 20) {
  x = x - 10;
} else {
  x = 10;
}

// No: Loops
while (gamePlaying) {
  render();
}
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) {
  printHi();
}

var fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'banana'];
var fruitToPrice = {
  apple: 0.99,
  pear: 0.5,
  banana: 0.25
};
// Yes: Expression
_.minBy(fruits, function(fruit) {
  return fruitToPrice[fruit];
// This anonymous function is like a literal.
});
```
