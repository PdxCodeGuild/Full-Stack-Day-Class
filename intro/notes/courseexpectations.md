# Class Expectations
You are adults.
This class will treat you as such and expects that attitude in return.
Not like a high-school or CC class.
Like being an apprentice and doing academic research.

## Attendance
By taking this course, you're setting aside time to learn.
**Keep it sacred. I cannot stress this enough.**

We require you to come to **90% of the sessions**.
Missing a day here is month of a college course.
Attendance is taken.
If you can't be very sure that you'll be present for more than required amount of sessions, this is _not the course for you_.

If you have medical reasons to miss class, that's fine, but please let me know _before hand_.

That's totally fine!
A bootcamp format is not the only way to learn these skills.
If that might be the case, let me know _now_.

With this in mind, keep a balanced life.
Feel free to _take breaks_ during the day.
Take a lap around the building.
If you need to go home sick for a day, go home.

## Attitude
This class is _immersive_.
It will only be about a 5th lecture.

I want you to **act** and not study.
That is why I will be checking your problems.
Seek out help, but learn to be independent.
When you finish this course you will _not_ know everything.
We will teach you the _basic building blocks_ but you have to be prepared to expand upon them.
Being a software developer is a process of continually learning.

You are paying for access to Code Guild's human expertise.
Ask questions.
Pick my brain.
**Look at my demos.**
If you have any questions or want more practice, **ask me for it**.
Outside-of-class tutoring can always be arranged with Chris Jones.
He is super nice and helpful.

Class will look like:
1. Concept
1. Demo
1. Group Practice
1. Individual Practice
1. Checked Practice
1. Repeat

I want you to succeed!
All of these rules are flexible, but realize they're to push you and make the class valuable.
If you need an exception to anything, let me know _before_ the action.
