# Practice: Case Conversion
Write a program that prompts the user for a word in `snake_case`, then converts and prints it out in `CamelCase`.
Also do the reverse conversion.

## Advanced
* Write functions to handle `kebab-case` and `CONSTANT_CASE`.
* Write functions to auto-detect which case is input.
* Automatically print out all other cases on input.
* Come up with a original-case-agnostic intermediate representation.
