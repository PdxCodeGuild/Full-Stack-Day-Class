## Channel to the Happy Path
Have the simplest control flow be the **happy path**, the path that will be taken where there are no exceptions or setup.
Then channel your edge cases into the happy path and doing any missing setup instead of bypassing the happy path.

This avoids duplicating operations and having to debug twice.

Fine:
```python
store_product_price_tuples = [
  ('Fred Meyer', 'apple', 1.00),
  ('Safeway', 'apple', 1.25),
  ('Safeway', 'pear', 1.50),
]
store_to_product_to_price = {}
for store, product, price in store_product_price_tuples:
  # Duplicates dictionary setting.
  if store not in store_to_product_to_price:
    store_to_product_to_price[store] = {product: price}
  else:
    store_to_product_to_price[store][product] = price
```

Better:
```python
store_to_product_to_price = {}
for store, product, price in store_product_price_tuples:
  # Channel edge case to happy path.
  if store not in store_to_product_to_price:
    store_to_product_to_price[store] = {}

  # Happy path.
  store_to_product_to_price[store][product] = price
```

# Focus on Transformation Problem
I love that some of you are error checking people's input.
It's great that you care about the user experience of your program.
_For now_ focus on the language features and data transformation in the problems I give you.
Don't worry about normalizing input, bounds checking, retrying input, or having descriptive errors in your first pass of a solution.
That optional complexity makes it hard to know where your bugs are sometimes.
