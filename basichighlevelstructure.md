# Basic High-Level Structure
It starts out intimidating to write code from scratch to solve a problem.
Use the following rubric to help:

1. Input --
Get data from your user.
Save it in variables.
1. Setup --
Set any variables that are fixed with every run.
1. Transform --
Do work!
Solve your problem!
Transform your input values into output values.
1. Output --
Print out labeled answers that came from your transform step.

Avoid mixing printing out your final answers with transforming your data.
It might seem straightforward, but it then requires you to keep track of when you printed out values, which can get confusing later.

Break your problem into these steps and work on them one at a time.
