# Course Portfolio
You should save all of the code you write in this class.
Employers will want to look at it to see examples of your work when hiring you.

You _must_ turn your `~/codeguild` folder into a Git repo and be committing your work to it as you progress through the class.

For now, that history will just be saved locally, but we'll be publishing your repo publicly to GitHub later.
