# Class Expectations
## Attendance
By taking this class, you're setting aside time to learn.
**Keep it sacred. I cannot stress this enough.**

You _must_ come to every session.
Missing a day here is month of a college course.
Attendance is taken.
If you can't be 99% sure that you'll be present for the entirety of all of the sessions, this is _not the course for you_.
If that might be the case, let me know _now_.
That's totally fine!
A bootcamp format is not the only way to learn these skills.

With this in mind, keep a balanced life.
Feel free to take breaks during the day.
Take a lap around the building.
If you need to go home sick for a day, go home.

## Attitude
Seek out help, but learn to be independent.
When you finish this course you will _not_ know everything.
Being a software developer is a process of continually learning.

You are paying for access to human power.
Ask questions.
Pick my brain.
**Look at my demos.**
After-class tutoring can always be arranged with Chris Jones.
He is super nice and helpful.

Class will look like:
1. Concept
1. Demo
1. Group Practice
1. Individual Practice
1. Checked Practice
1. Repeat

## Practice
There are no grades.
This course is pass / fail.
I will continuously be giving you informal evaluations of your work.

Occasionally I will give **checked practice** where I will evaluate your work _stringently_ based on the topics we've covered thus far and send you a write up.
They are to formally assess your progress.
If you are seriously falling behind, you will have to drop the class.

Many of our class projects will be **group practice**.
I will be explicitly assigning you to groups of two or three.
I will rotate the groups so you will work with everyone in the class.
There are no exceptions to this.
