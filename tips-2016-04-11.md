## Lists are Referenced by Identity
When you use a variable that has a list in it, you are referencing the _exact same instance_ of the list.
When you reference it multiple times _and modify it_, it can have unintuitive effects.
```python
inner = [1, 2]
outer = [inner, inner]
print(outer) # [[1, 2], [1, 2]]
outer[0].append(3)
print(outer)  # [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
```

To avoid this problem, avoid using the in-place modifying list functions.

Best:
```python
inner = [1, 2]
outer = [inner, inner]
print(outer) # [[1, 2], [1, 2]]
outer[0] = outer[0] + [3]
print(outer)  # [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2]]
```

If necessary, you can also **copy** a list by passing it through `list()`.

Okay:
```python
inner = [1, 2]
outer = [list(inner), list(inner)]
print(outer) # [[1, 2], [1, 2]]
outer[0].append(3)
print(outer)  # [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2]]
```

## Range for Building
List comprehensions and `range()` is the best way to build repetitive lists quickly.

```python
one_hundred_puppies = ['puppy' for _ in range(100)]
```

## Cast Zip and Enumerate to List
`zip` and `enumerate` return things that look _like_ lists, but aren't.
Cast their result to a list every time to prevent trouble.

```python
l = ['a', 'b', 'c']
reversed(enumerate(l))  # Throws TypeError
reversed(list(enumerate(l)))  #> [(2, 'c'), (1, 'b'), (0, 'a')]
```

## Zip Splat for Transposing
If you have a matrix as a list of lists and you want to **transpose** or swap rows and columns, use `zip()` and the splat operator `*`.
```python
l = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
zip(*l)  #> [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
```
