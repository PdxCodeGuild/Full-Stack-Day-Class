# Hot Tips: 2016-03-29
## Cast Early on Input, Late on Output
Often your input comes in as strings.
Convert your data to the type that best represents it as early as possible.
Then work with it in that best type.
Then only cast out to a string for output.

Bad:
```python
print('How old are you?')
age = input()

next_year = str(int(age) + 1)

print('Next year your age is ' + next_year)
```

Better:
```python
print('How old are you?')
age = int(input())

next_year = age + 1

print('Next year your age is ' + str(next_year))
```

## Grouping Means Dict
When part of your problem involves grouping, you'll almost always want to use a dict.
A dict is a great way to collect.

Even when all of the groupings or options are known!
Whenever you have separate variables, you then have to have explicitly handle or search all the cases.
With a dict, you can loop or lookup easily.

Avoid:
```python
monday_alarm_time = 7
tuesday_alarm_time = 7
wednesday_alarm_time = 7
thursday_alarm_time = 7
friday_alarm_time = 8

def alarm_for_day(day):
  if day == 'monday':
    return monday_alarm_time
  elif day == 'tuesday':
    return tuesday_alarm_time
  ...

def print_alarm_schedule():
  print('Monday', monday_alarm_time)
  print('Monday', tuesday_alarm_time)
  ...
```

Instead:
```python
day_to_alarm_time = {
  'monday': 7,
  'tuesday': 7,
  'wednesday': 7,
  'thursday': 7,
  'friday': 8,
}

def alarm_for_day(day):
  return day_to_alarm_time[day]

def print_alarm_schedule():
  for day, alarm_time in day_to_alarm_time.items():
    print(day, alarm_time)
```

## Trailing Commas are Ignored on Collection Literals
Yup.
The title.

All the following are equivalent:
```python
[
  1,
  2,
  3
]
```
```python
[
  1,
  2,
  3,
]
```
```python
[1, 2, 3]
```
```python
[1, 2, 3, ]
```

Same for dicts and sets and tuples.

I'd recommend _including_ trailing commas in just _multi-line_ collection literals.
It makes it easy to re-order things without shuffling about commas.
