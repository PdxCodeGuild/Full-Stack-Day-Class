# Javascript Basics
JS is another structured, procedural programming language.
Statements are executed one at a time from top to bottom within a function and functions can call each other.

Whitespace and indentation is ignored by the interpreter, but are important for readability.

Each statement must end with a `;`.

Blocks of code are delineated by braces `{}`.

There are two kinds of comments.
Single line comments start with `//` and comment out the remainder of the line.
Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/` and can span multiple lines.

Every JS file we write should be in **strict mode**.
This makes the behavior of variables less complicated.
At the top of every JS file, add:
```js
"use strict";
```

## The Good Parts
JS is a messy language.
It was rushed to implementation, and is often inconsistent.
You can still get stuff done in it.
