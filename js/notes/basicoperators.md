# Basic Operators
## Math
All of the math operators are the same.
E.g. `+`, `-`,  `%`.

`+` works as string concatenation.

All of the same advanced assignment operators work.
E.g. `+=`.

The only new operators you will encounter are `++` and `--` which add and subtract `1`.
_Avoid_ using them instead of `x += 1`.
They act strange in compound statements.

## Comparison
* `===` is equals (notice it's **triple equals**)
* `!==` is not equals (notice it's **not triple equals**)

All of the other comparison operators are the same.
E.g. `<`.

You might encounter a `==` and `!=` operator.
They are [almost the same](http://www.impressivewebs.com/why-use-triple-equals-javascipt/) as the triple equals versions.
_Avoid_ using the double versions.

## Boolean Logic
* `&&` is and
* `||` is or
* `!` is not (it prefixes what you want to negate)
