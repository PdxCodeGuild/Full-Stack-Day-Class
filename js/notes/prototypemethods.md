# Prototype Methods
Python had type methods, similarly JS has prototype methods.
Without going into too much detail now, every instance of an object in JS is a "copy" of an original **prototype**, just with real values filled in.
You can look at the prototypes to see what methods are available.

As a crash course, here are the prototype methods on [strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#Methods_2) and  [arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Methods_2).
Awkwardly, there aren't really prototype methods for objects in the same way Python dictionaries had type methods.
You can look at the [full reference for all types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference).
