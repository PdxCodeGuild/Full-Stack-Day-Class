# Hot Tips: 2016-04-01
## Explicit Main Function
My advice was to have functions only take in inputs via arguments and output via a return value.

Let's say we want to append 1 to a list of numbers.

Bad:
```python
l = [3, 2]
def append_one():
  l.append(1)
new_l = l
```

Better:
```python
l = [3, 2]
def append_one(l):
  return l + [1]
new_l = append_one(l)
```

But since you can silently reach outside of a function's scope to read variables, it was sometimes hard to notice when you were breaking the advice.
If you put the top-level steps of your program in a function called `main` or something like it, you'll then get an error when you forget my advice.

Errors:
```python
def append_one():
  return l + [1]  #> throws NameError

def main():
  l = [3, 2]
  new_l = append_one()
  print(new_l)

main()
```

Best:
```python
def append_one(l):
  return l + [1]

def main():
  l = [3, 2]
  new_l = append_one(l)
  print(new_l)

main()
```

## Values are Values are Values
All things that return a value are called **expressions**.
We know a lot of things that are expressions:
* Literals return themselves. `3`
* Operators with inputs return their result. `1 + 2` or `thing_to_legs['tripod']`
* Variables return the value inside of them. `x`
* Function calls return their return values. `pow(3, 1)`

Whenever you need a value, _all of these are interchangeable_.

All of these result in `3`:
```python
3  #> 3
1 + 2  #> 3
x = 3
x  #> 3
pow(3, 1)  #> 3
pow(3, 0 + 1)  #> 3
pow(1 + 1 + 1, 1)  #> 3
y = 1
pow(3, y)  #> 3
pow(y + y + 1, y)  #> 3
```

So similarly, since collection literals just take expressions:
```python
[1, 2, 3]  #> [1, 2, 3]
x = 2
[1, x, 3]  #> [1, 2, 3]
[x - 1, x, x + 1]  #> [1, 2, 3]
l = [3, 3, 3]
[pow(x, 0), 2, l[1]]  #> [1, 2, 3]

y = 'tripod'
thing_to_legs = {y: l[0]}
thing_to_legs['tripod']  #> 3
thing_to_legs['tri' + 'pod']  #> 3
```

Booleans are also just values and those boolean operators are just operators:
```python
y = True
y and True
x = 3 == 3
[True, y, y or x]
```

`return` and `for` and `if` also work this way!
```python
return 3
return pow(x, 0)
for x in [pow(x, 0), 2, l[1]]
for x in l + [4]
b = False
bl = [False, True]
if True
if b
if bl[1]
```

## Command Line Fu
* `up` / `ctrl-p` (previous) and `down` / `ctrl-n` (next) will show you previous and next commands you've written.
You can edit them and press enter to run them again.
* `ctrl-a` and `ctrl-e` (end) bring the cursor to the beginning and end of the line.
* `ctrl-r` let's you "reverse search" all of your previous commands with what you type in next.
Keep pressing `ctrl-r` to go backwards further.
You can then use `up` / `ctrl-p` and `down` / `ctrl-n` to list through them.
* `ctrl-k` will clear the line from the cursor to the end.
* `alt-f` (forward) and `alt-b` (backward) let you move the cursor by whole words.

Many of these work in Atom too.
