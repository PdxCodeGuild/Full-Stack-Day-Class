# Type Methods
Classes allow you to define methods

For type methods, you need to _already have_ an instance of the class.
This means functions that find an instance or make a new instance _should not_ be type methods.

You should use the short form.
The short form is magic;
I don't have to know the exact type!

Start by writing all of your functions _outside_ of classes.
Only move ones in that follow the above rules.
