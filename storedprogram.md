# Stored Program Computer
Your computer uses the **stored program model**.
This means the instructions for each program are stored as _files_ on the hard drive.

When you are writing Python code, you create a file that stores all the instructions.
You then tell the computer to later **execute** that code.
It will follow the instructions, but on whatever _new input_ is given that time.
