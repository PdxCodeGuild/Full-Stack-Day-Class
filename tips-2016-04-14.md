# Hot Tips: 2016-04-14
## Using StackOverflow
I wrote up some guidelines for [googling for solutions](notes/googling.md).

## Truthiness
If statements take in a boolean, right?
Well, they actually take in _any type_ and use some [truth rules](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing) to decide if the value "is true".

Basically, `False`, zeros, or empty things are "false".
```python
a = False
if a:
    print("Skipped")
else:
    print('Happens!')
b = 0.0
if b:
    print("Skipped")
else:
    print('Happens!')
c = {}
if c:
    print("Skipped")
else:
    print('Happens!')
d = []
if d:
    print("Skipped")
else:
    print('Happens!')
```

To check manually, you can cast something to a bool.
```python
bool([])  #> False
bool({1: 2})  #> True
```

Yes, you don't get an error, but _avoid_ doing this!
Sometimes non-intuitive things happen.
Always explicitly use bool types in if statements or explicitly check `len(a) == 0` for empty containers.

## Avoid Index Arithmetic
Try to come up with ways to phrase your problem that don't use indices.
Solutions using them tend to be error-prone and hard to debug.

Instead of going through each index
```python
for i in range(len(l)):
    x = l[i]
    ...
```
go through each item
```python
for x in l:
    ...
```

Instead of pairing together lists by index
```python
for i in range(len(l1)):
    x = l1[i]
    y = l2[i]
    ...
```
zip them together
```python
for x, y in zip(l1, l2):
    ...
```

Instead of using indices by offset
```python
for i in range(len(l - 1)):
    x1 = l[i]
    x2 = l[i + 1]
    ...
```
zip together an offset
```python
for x1, x2 in zip(l, l[1:]):
    ...
```

## Cheat Sheet Errata
Missing `str.replace(old, new)`.
