# Global Objects

JS doesn't have formal "modules", but does provide global objects with convenient helper methods on them.

There are some [docs on the availible ones](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects).

* `Math`
* `String`
* `Date`
* `RegExp`

```js
Math.abs(-10);  //> 10
```
