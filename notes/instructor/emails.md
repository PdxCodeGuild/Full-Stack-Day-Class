## First Day

```
Hello students!

My name is David Selassie. I'll be your instructor for PDX Code Guild's Developer Bootcamp course. The first class is this XXX starting at XXX in the PDX Code Guild room of the PSU Startup Accelerator, 2828 SW Corbett Ave, Portland, OR. On the first floor, turn left down the hallway and the classroom is on the right at almost at the end of the first straightaway; please ask the front desk if you get lost.

We will be going over expectations for the course, setting up laptops, and starting on basics. Please bring your laptop, charger, paper notebook, and pen for scratch work to each class session.

Class sessions are every weekday from 9:30 A.M. until 4:30 P.M. through XXX or 12 weeks. We will have XXX off. Greater than 90% class session attendance is required to graduate. If there are any days that you already know you'll be absent, you can ask for a limited number of excused absences by emailing me specific dates before the first day of class.

If you ever have any questions, email me back at this address. Looking forward to meeting you!

Best,
David

## Satisfactory

```
Hey XXX!

Good work on your code for the XXX practice problem! It is satisfactory.

I posted some minor feedback as comments on the diff of your pull request XXX . I suggest you spend some time implementing it to practice good habits.

Once you're done with any cleanup, merge your pull request into master, delete that feature branch, `pull master` locally, and delete the feature branch locally.

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.

Best,
David
```

## Not Satisfactory

```
Hey XXX,

Good work on your code for the XXX practice problem! It solves the problem, but it didn't demonstrate XXX. As a reminder, the goal of the course is not just to write code that solves a problem, but to write code of a professional.

I'd like you to submit another pass on your solution due at the beginning of class XXX. Please push another revision under the same branch name; the pull request will be updated automatically. I posted feedback as comments on the diff of your pull request XXX .

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.

Best,
David
```

## No Submission

```
Hey XXX,

I don't see a branch containing your solution to the XXX practice problem pushed to GitHub and it was due today.

Did you forget to push your changes? Are they committed as part of a feature branch named `XXX`? Did you make an appropriately named pull request also named `XXX` for that branch? In the future, please preview your Pull Requests after you've completed a problem to ensure you're submitting the correct code.

As of now you have XXX late assignments. As a reminder, only three late assignments are allowed in the class. If you ever need an extension on an problem, that's fine, but please let me know before it is due.

Please let me know if you have any questions or are having trouble finishing the assignment.

Best,
David
```

## Distinction

Hey XXX!

Excellent work on your code for the XXX practice problem! This code earns distinction for demonstrating great use of all the techniques we've learned thus far.

I posted some minor and advanced feedback as comments on the diff of your pull request XXX . I suggest you spend some time implementing it to continue practicing good habits.

Once you're done with any cleanup, merge your pull request into master, delete that feature branch, `pull master` locally, and delete the feature branch locally.

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.

## Tutoring

```
Hey XXX,

I'd like you to schedule some tutoring time with Chris Jones or Katie Dover this or next week. You should work on XXX.

Chris and Katie are CCd here. Shoot them an email to work out scheduling.

David
```

## Attendance

```
Hey XXX,

We've been missing you in class a lot of late!

As a reminder of class policy, you need to maintain at least a 90% attendance rate to stay in the class. Missing today puts you at XX%. If you do drop below 90% attendance, you have two weeks to work back up to that level of attendance.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the course policy.

Best,
David

## Satisfactory Capstone Proposal

Hey XXX!

Your proposal looks great and is satisfactory! There are a few minor bits of feedback I want to give:

XXX

Please update your capstone proposal with this minor feedback and commit it before you continue on.

Your capstone proposal is checked off and you can formally start work on it. You should work on your capstone whenever you have free time in the course, even if it's just a very isolated part.

This proposal is a "living document". As your capstone work progresses, please update the proposal to accurately describe the data model, features, and development schedule that your project actually has.

Feel free to come with me for guidance or with questions at any time.

Best,
David

## Not Satisfactory Capstone Proposal

## Course Evaluation

Hey Class!

As we approach the end of the course, PDX Code Guild and I would like to get feedback on what you thought worked, didn't work, liked, didn't like, and any suggestions at all about the course content, course logistics, instruction, me, or the school. PDX Code Guild is still growing and honing its curriculum and priorities, and your feedback is crucial to improving.

I've prepared an anonymous survey, that I'd like you to take:

>>> Course Evaluation Survey <<<

Please have your responses submitted by the end of the day XXX so I can read and summarize them. If you have any questions about the survey, or further feedback or comments come to mind at any time, don't hesitate to email me or Sheri.

Best,
David

## Satisfactory Capstone Feedback and Course Certificate

CC Sheri

```
Hey XXX!

Good work on your capstone! I have been looking at the most recent commit on your `master` branch, >>> XXX <<<, and your capstone is satisfactory /// distinguished /// ! I have no further feedback on it beyond my comments in previous emails. I encourage you to read back over the comments and try and implement them as a way to continue to practice and hone your skills.

You've now completed all of the requirements for the course and have earned your certificate /// with distinction /// for PDX Code Guild's Developer Bootcamp! Be proud of your accomplishments! Mark it on your resume right now. Your attendance rate was XXX%. XXX of your assignments were turned in late and XXX received distinction.

Your class' public demo day is on XXX at XXX P.M. Again, it is technically optional, but we strongly encourage you to attend, show off, and celebrate your work! We'll be in email contact closer to the date. Refer to the >>> demo day page in the course syllabus <<< if you have questions in the meantime.

Please fill out the >>> anonymous course evaluation <<<, if you haven't, by the end of the day XXX. We really value your truthful feedback in order to improve the instruction and curriculum.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments. Good luck in your future endeavors!

## Demo Day Reminder

```
Hey Class!

Demo Day approaches! It is XXX. Arrive a little early at XXX P.M. in the main PDX Code Guild building (the brick one). >>> Here is an invitation <<< you can forward to anyone you would like to attend. Please have them RSVP using that invitation so we know how many guests to expect. If you're not planning on presenting, please send Sheri and I an email.

As a reminder:

You'll prepare a short presentation showing off your capstone to hiring managers, friends, family, and other students. Tell a clear, concise, and directed story that shows off what you've created in five minutes. Consult my >>> notes on Demo Day <<< for more information.

Five minutes is exceedingly short! Practice your presentation multiple times before you give it live to understand how short that is. Practice giving it to someone who is unfamiliar with your project to gauge understanding. I also suggest presenting from a quick slide deck rather than using a live demo to avoid snafus, but if you have a functional project you're welcome to show that off!

When you arrive early, double check that your laptop works with the projector and we'll come up with an order of the presenters (it will probably be alphabetical by full name). Another course has also finished and will be presenting the same evening, so there will be a few more presenters.

Please let me know if you have any questions. >>> Sheri <<< and >>> Katie <<< are available to coach and practice your presentations with before the presentation if you'd like.

Best,
David
