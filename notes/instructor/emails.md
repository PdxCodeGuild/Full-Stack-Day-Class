## First Day

```
Hello students!

My name is David Selassie. I'll be your instructor for PDX Code Guild's Developer Bootcamp course. The first class is this XXX starting at XXX in the PDX Code Guild room of the PSU Startup Accelerator, 2828 SW Corbett Ave, Portland, OR. On the first floor, turn left down the hallway and the classroom is on the right at almost at the end of the first straightaway; please ask the front desk if you get lost.

We will be going over expectations for the course, setting up laptops, and starting on basics. Please bring your laptop, charger, paper notebook, and pen for scratch work to each class session.

Class sessions are every weekday from 9:30 A.M. until 4:30 P.M. through XXX or 12 weeks. We will have XXX off. Greater than 90% class session attendance is required to graduate. If there are any days that you already know you'll be absent, you can ask for a limited number of excused absences by emailing me specific dates before the first day of class.

If you ever have any questions, email me back at this address. Looking forward to meeting you!

Best,
David

## Satisfactory

```
Hey XXX!

Good work on your code for the XXX practice problem! It is satisfactory.

I posted some minor feedback as comments on the diff of your pull request XXX . I suggest you spend some time implementing it to practice good habits.

Once you're done with any cleanup, merge your pull request into master, delete that feature branch, `pull master` locally, and delete the feature branch locally.

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.

Best,
David

## Not Satisfactory

```
Hey XXX,

Good work on your code for the XXX practice problem! It solves the problem, but it didn't demonstrate XXX. As a reminder, the goal of the course is not just to write code that solves a problem, but to write code of a professional.

I'd like you to submit another pass on your solution due at the beginning of class XXX. Please push another revision under the same branch name; the pull request will be updated automatically. I posted feedback as comments on the diff of your pull request XXX .

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.

Best,
David
```

## No Submission

```
Hey XXX,

I don't see a branch containing your solution to the XXX practice problem pushed to GitHub and it was due today.

Did you forget to push your changes? Are they committed as part of a feature branch named `XXX`? Did you make an appropriately named pull request also named `XXX` for that branch? In the future, please preview your Pull Requests after you've completed a problem to ensure you're submitting the correct code.

As of now you have XXX late assignments. As a reminder, only three late assignments are allowed in the class. If you ever need an extension on an problem, that's fine, but please let me know before it is due.

Please let me know if you have any questions or are having trouble finishing the assignment.

Best,
David
```

## Tutoring

Hey XXX,

I'd like you to schedule some tutoring time with Chris Jones or Katie Dover this or next week. You should work on XXX.

## Attendance

```
Hey XXX,

We've been missing you in class a lot of late!

As a reminder of class policy, you need to maintain at least a 90% attendance rate to stay in the class. Missing today puts you at XX%. If you do drop below 90% attendance, you have two weeks to work back up to that level of attendance.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the course policy.

David

This proposal is a "living document". As your capstone work progresses, please update the proposal to accurately describe the data model, features, and development schedule that your project actually has.
