## Not Satisfactory

Hey XXX,

Good work on your code for the XXX practice problem! It solves the problem, but it didn't demonstrate using XXX. As a reminder, the goal of the course is not just to write code that solves a problem, but to write code of a professional.

I'd like you to submit another pass on your solution due at the beginning of class XXX.

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.

Hey XXX,

I don't see any changes to your XXX practice problem pushed to GitHub and a revision of it was due today.

Did you forget to push your changes? Are they committed part of the XXX branch? Did you push that branch?

Please let me know if you have any questions about my previous feedback or are having trouble finishing the assignment.

Best,
David
