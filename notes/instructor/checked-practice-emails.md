# Checked Practice Response Emails

## Satisfactory

Hey XXX!

Good work on your code for the XXX practice problem! It is satisfactory.

I posted some minor feedback as comments on the diff of your pull request XXX . I suggest you spend some time implementing it to practice good habits. Once you're done with any cleanup, merge your pull request into master, delete that feature branch, `pull master` locally, and delete the feature branch locally.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or feedback.

Best,
David

## Not Satisfactory

Hey XXX,

Good work on your code for the XXX practice problem! It solves the problem, but it didn't demonstrate XXX. As a reminder, the goal of the course is not just to write code that solves a problem, but to write code of a professional.

I'd like you to submit another pass on your solution due at the beginning of class XXX. Please push another revision under the same branch name; the pull request will be updated automatically. I posted feedback as comments on the diff of your pull request XXX .

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.

Best,
David

## No Updates

Hey XXX,

I don't see any changes to your XXX practice problem pushed to GitHub and a revision of it was due today.

Did you forget to push your changes? Are they committed as part of a feature branch named XXX? Did you push that branch?

Please let me know if you have any questions about my previous feedback or are having trouble finishing the assignment.

Best,
David
