# Group Work
We will be doing many group practice problems in this course.
This is not negotiable.

Working with others is learned skill that we're explicitly teaching in this course.

I will be explicitly assigning you to groups of two or three.
I will rotate the groups so you will work with everyone in the class.

## Pair Programming
The group assignments will be **pair programming**.
This means you work at _one_ computer and tag off typing.
Both people are engaged.

Try tagging out every 15 minutes.

## Attitude
Everyone in this class comes from different backgrounds and skill-sets.
**Respect** everyone you work with.

You're _primary goal_ in the group should be to help the other person learn.
You will learn through that process too.

### Be Open Minded
Learn _why_ someone wants to make a decision before you critique it.
Assume everyone is logical.
Conflicts often come from not seeing some underlying disconnect.

E.g. Don't say, "That shouldn't live in that class." Say, "Why did you put that method in that class?"

### Respect the Person
Learn to provide _constructive_ criticism.
Ask about the fundamentals, don't critique the solution.

E.g. Don't say, "That isn't a good function name." Ask, "Could we name that function better? Does that name reflect the data inside?"

### Accommodate Other Learning Styles
Not everyone visualizes problems in the same way.
_Listen_ to their explanation and try to _match_ their style.
This is a skill to practice, not to avoid.

Try repeating things in multiple ways.

### Feelings are Great
**There are no wrong feelings**, just wrong reactions to feelings.
If you feel frustrated or confused, let your partner know.
If your partner tells you they feel frustrated or confused, take a moment and think about how to address that feeling.
**Do not discount it.**
