# JS Objects Review

* Objects can contain values and functions.
* Functions can modify the neighboring values in the object for OO-style programming using `this`.
* Functions might be provided by the prototype.
* A capitalized constructor function, called with `new`, sets up the values and prototype.
* Those functions form an interface, so you don't need to know the details.
