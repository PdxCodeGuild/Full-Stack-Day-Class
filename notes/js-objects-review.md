# JS Objects Review

* Objects can contain values and functions.
* Functions can modify the neighboring values in the object for OO-style programming using `this`.
* Property are looked up in the current object, then in the prototype if they don't exist.
* A capitalized constructor function, called with `new`, sets up the values in `this` and prototype.

These features all allow you to encapsulate data, define an interface, and share functionality.
