# Course Portfolio

You will be saving all of your practice problem solutions and capstone as a public **portfolio** of your work on [GitHub](https://github.com).
It's a great public record of your work that you can show to prospective employers.
This is also how you will be submitting checked assignments.

I suggest you make a `codeguild` directory in your home directory.
It would have the full path `~/codeguild`.
I will call this your **repo root directory**.

I suggest you keep it organized and tidy as a public reflection of yourself.

```
codeguild/
    readme.md
    practice/
        ...
    notes/
        ...
```
