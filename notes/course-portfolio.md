# Course Portfolio

You will be saving all of your practice problem solutions as a public **portfolio** of your work on [GitHub](https://github.com).
It's a great public record of your work that you can show to prospective employers.
This is also how you will be submitting checked assignments.

I suggest you keep it organized and tidy as a public reflection of yourself.
