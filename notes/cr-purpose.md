# CR Purpose

**Code review** or **CR** is the process by which another (usually more senior developer) looks at your code and vets it before it is included in the product.

There are a few goals of CR. Mainly, increase the chances only ["good"](/notes/cr-good-code.md) code makes it into the code base. Secondarily, spread knowledge about the code base or programming in general.

Just like no author releases a novel or article without a proofreader and editor, no developer should release code without review.
This is usually a non-negotiable part of professional software development.

Remember that developers are engineers, not hit-men; they're not paid to get the job "done", they're paid to create code.
**Code is your product; make it good.**
When you write code with another peer viewing, reading, and understanding it in mind, you will produce better code.

CR is also a skill to hone.
It is not innate, just like programming or public speaking isn't.
It's okay if you're nervous or bad at it at first.
As long as you have the drive to improve, you will!
