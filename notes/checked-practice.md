# Checked Practice
There are no grades.
This course is pass / fail.
I will continuously be giving you informal evaluations of your work.

I also give **checked practices** where I will evaluate your work _stringently_ based on the topics we've covered thus far and send you a write up.
**You must complete all of these assignments and submit them via GitHub.**
They are to formally assess your progress.
The goal of this class is to become a proficient developer;
the only way to demonstrate that to me is to actually submit working programs.
We want you to succeed in your capstone, and we want to make sure you're prepared.

If you are seriously falling behind, you will have to drop the class.

Many of our class projects will be **group practice**.
This class has [expectations about group work](/notes/group-work.md).

When I give you checked feedback, you should spend some time to implement the changes I suggest.
I'll only tell you to formally re-submit the problem if it's grossly not working.
Otherwise it's still great practice to re-do what I give you feedback on.
