Python style says that lines shouldn't be more than 80 characters.
This is so each statement is simple and you can imagine it in your mind.

Here are a few techniques to make your code easier to follow.

## 1. Use Variables

Variables are free, so use them all the time!
Whenever you have a concept in a program, put it in a variable.

```py
miles = 300
miles_per_gallon = 30
cost_per_gallon_of_gas = 2.50

road_trip_cost = miles / miles_per_gallon * cost_per_gallon_of_gas
```

## 2. Use Functions

Functions are also almost free

## 3. Use String Literal Joining

## 4. Use Parentheses
