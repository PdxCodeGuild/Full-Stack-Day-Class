# Course Logistics
Each class session begins at 9:30 A.M. every week day and ends at 4:30 P.M.
We will take an hour-long lunch break every day from 12:30 P.M. to 1:30 P.M.

## Bikes
Bikes can be locked up out front of the Accelerator, or in the basement parking lot.
To get to the basement, take the elevator or stairs from the lobby.
You'll have to walk around to the front door to get back up, unfortunately.

Bikes are not allowed to be stored in the classroom.

## Cars
Cars can be parked during the day behind the main PDX Code Guild building, 2626 SW Kelly Ave, the brick one.
You may also park on the street after 4pm.
