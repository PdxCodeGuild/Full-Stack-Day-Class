# Interface Principles
In this class you will learn _basic_ HTML and CSS to format web pages.
The results do _not have to be pretty_.
The point of this part of the course is to learn the principles and structures,

Similar to learning to code in Python, there is infinite depth possible.
We are learning just enough to code up a minimum interface for a web app.

## HTML
The **structure** of your interface is provided by HTML, **hypertext markup language**.
Notice that name, it _marks up_ existing text; it's not a programming language.

## CSS
The **presentation** of your interface is provided by CSS, **cascading style sheets**.

It has a way of specifying how the different structures you specified in your HTML are actually displayed.
