# None

It is a value that represents the absece of a value.

```py
x = None

def print_hi():
    print('hi')

x = print_hi()

cmd = ''
while cmd != 'quit':
    cmd = input('What should I do? ')
    do(cmd)
```

Basically any time you might think about None, think about empty list or string or False.
