# Capstone Requirements

A satisfactory capstone **demonstrates personal understanding** of all of the topics in the course, incorporated into a _cohesive_ single web app:

* Python language basics
* Use of Django templating and views
* Design of Django routes
* Incorporating user input to and from views
* Isolated Python logic layer
* Django models for persistent storage
* Proper Python application and repo packaging
* Semantic HTML structure
* CSS style
* Flexbox layout
* JavaScript language basics
* jQuery DOM manipulation and event handling
* Code structuring techniques throughout
* Documentation via relevant comments, docstrings, and a [readme](/notes/capstone-readme.md)
* Unit testing of functional parts
* Proper language style throughout
* Maintain a living proposal document

_Merely using_ a topic does not automatically constitute "understanding";
the use must contribute to the project meaningfully, be produced by you personally, show why the topic is useful, and demonstrate its usage via the methods taught in this class.

Your goal is to demonstrate to me that you understand and can use the skills taught in the class.
If I look at your provided code and can't see that, then that does not constitute a satisfactory capstone.

Code based upon external sources (StackOverflow, blog post snippets, etc.) is not exempt from all of the above requirements (e.g. code structuring techniques and proper style).

I will reject project proposals that do not have the ability to show understanding of all of these topic areas.

You are encouraged to go beyond "understanding" towards **mastery** in areas of your interest.
Commitment and striving for mastery in a topic area is appreciated by prospective employers.
