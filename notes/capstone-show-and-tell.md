# Capstone Show and Tell

The morning of the last day of class will be **show-and-tell time**.
Each person will get about 15 minutes to demo their capstone on the projector to the rest of the class.

This is meant to be a real chill time.
It is not part of the capstone requirements and I won't be evaluating it.
Other students are interested in what you've made, though, and would like to see it!

Feel free to do whatever you want to show off your project, but as a rough suggested outline:

1. Describe your capstone project at a high level.
1. Walk through a demo of the functional parts.
1. Talk about any challenges you faced and any cool technical parts.
