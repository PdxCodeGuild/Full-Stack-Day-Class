# Django Overview
**Django** is a Python library that includes a ton of generic, basic tools for making a dynamic website.

It gives you [web framework](/notes/webframework.md) to handle the piping involved in a web server and a [ORM](/notes/orm.md) to talk to a database easily.
It also gives you an "admin interface" to your database that auto generates pages that let you debug and inspect the values in there.

Django does _not_ fill the same role as WordPress or Drupal.
Both of those are **content management systems**.
They give you a pre-made interface to upload content and have it be displayed on a web page.
They are opinionated about the structure of content you can use, although they are extendable through plugins that you can write.
You can probably make a CMS do all the things you do here, but you'll often be working _against_ it's options rather than working with the basic tools of Django.
