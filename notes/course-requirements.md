# Course Requirements

## Completion Requirements

To pass the course and receive your certificate, you must complete three requirements.

If you are currently failing any of the requirements, you will receive a warning.
If you do not return to passing all of the requirements within 14 days, you will be removed from the course.

Due dates are linked from our schedule on the top of [the syllabus](/).

### 1. Attendance

You are required to attend **>90% of the class sessions**.
There are _no exceptions_ to this rule because of the immersive nature of the class.
Attendance is taken.

Being more than 15 minutes late or leaving more than 15 minutes early counts as a tardy.
_Three_ tardies counts as an absence.
Tardies count towards your attendance percentage.

**Keep your class time sacred. I cannot stress this enough.**

If you are not sure you can attend the required amount of class sessions, this is _not the course for you_.
That's totally fine!
An immersive all-day format is not the only way to learn these skills.
Let me know _now_, if you're concerned.

The class is immersive, but not oppressive:
Please take short breaks outside during the day.
Please go home if you are sick.

### 2. Checked Practice

You are required to turn in satisfactory solutions to **all of the checked practice assignments**.
No more than _three_ late assignments are allowed.
Assignments will be turned in via pushing your [course portfolio](/notes/course-portfolio.md) to GitHub under the requested path.

If you need an extension on an assignments, that's fine if you let me know _before_ the due date.

A solution is **satisfactory** if it shows understanding of all of the topics we've covered thus far.
It is **unsatisfactory** if not.
A solution is **distinguished** if it completes any available advanced parts and shows solid understanding of all of the topics we've covered thus far.
There are no letter or number grades;
each solution is satisfactory, unsatisfactory, or distinguished.
I will _stringently_ review your solutions and email you feedback in a review of each checked assignment.

If your solution is not satisfactory, you are required to revise it based on my feedback and turn it in at a given later date until it is satisfactory.
I will usually also provide small feedback on satisfactory solutions;
please spend some time to go back and implement that feedback to practice.

The goal of this class is to become a proficient developer;
the only way to demonstrate that is to actually submit working programs.

### 3. Capstone

Your are required to turn in a satisfactory **capstone proposal and project**.

It is a large comprehensive project where you will demonstrate all of the skills learned.
We will go into [details about it](/notes/capstone-intro.md) later.

A capstone proposal is **satisfactory** if fulfills the [proposal requirements](/notes/capstone-proposal.md#requirements).
It is **unsatisfactory** if not.
A capstone is **satisfactory** if it fulfills the [capstone requirements](/notes/capstone-intro.md#requirements).
It is **unsatisfactory** if not.
A capstone is **distinguished** if it is satisfactory and also goes beyond the MVP proposed, shows solid understanding of all topics covered in the class, and explores topics not covered in the class.

## Distinction

This course can be passed **with distinction** if you turn in three or more distinguished checked practices, a distinguished capstone, and demonstrate a solid understanding of all topics covered in the class.

Distinction is reserved for truly cream-of-the-crop students.
