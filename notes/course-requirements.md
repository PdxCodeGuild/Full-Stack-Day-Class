# Course Requirements

This is a **pass / distinction / no certificate** course.

Although it might seem overbearing on the first day, out of respect for you, we want to make sure you completely understand all of the requirements you will be held to in order to pass.

## Completion Requirements

To pass the course and earn your certificate, you must complete four requirements.

If you are currently failing any of the requirements, I will email you a written warning.
If you do not return to passing all of the requirements within 14 days or by the end of class, whichever is sooner, **you will be removed from the course**.
This is out of respect for the other students.
There is lots of

Due dates are linked from our schedule on the top of [the syllabus](/).

### 1. Code of Conduct

You are required to uphold the [Code of Conduct](/notes/course-conduct.md) during the course.

### 2. Attendance

You are required to attend **>= 90% of the class sessions**.
The only exceptions are up to five days of excused absence already arranged before the course starts.
Attendance is taken.

Missing 15 minutes of class counts as a tardy.
_Three_ tardies counts as an absence.
Tardies count towards your attendance percentage.

If you are not sure you can reliably attend the required amount of class sessions, this is _not the course for you_.
That's totally fine!
An immersive all-day format is not the only way to learn these skills.
Let me know _now_, if you're concerned.

The class is immersive, but not oppressive:
Please take short breaks outside during the day.
Please go home if you are sick.

### 3. Checked Practice

You are required to turn in satisfactory solutions to **all of the checked practice assignments**.
Assignments will be turned in via pushing your [course portfolio](/notes/course-portfolio.md) to GitHub under the requested path.

No more than _three_ late assignments are allowed.
If you need an extension on an assignment, that's fine if you let me know _before_ the due date.

A solution is **satisfactory** if it shows understanding of all of the topics we've covered thus far.
It is **unsatisfactory** if not.
A solution is **distinguished** if it completes any available advanced parts and shows solid understanding of all of the topics we've covered thus far.
There are no letter or number grades;
each solution is satisfactory, unsatisfactory, or distinguished.
I will _stringently_ review your solutions and email you feedback in a review of each checked assignment.

All submitted work must be your own.
You are encouraged to use resources (online, books, each other) to research solutions, but please reference what or who helped you with a solution.

If your solution is not satisfactory, you are required to revise it based on my feedback and turn it in at a given later date until it is satisfactory.
I will usually also provide small feedback on satisfactory solutions;
please spend some time to go back and implement that feedback to practice.

Do not turn in half-baked assignments.
If you have extra time to work on an advanced version of the problem, work on it in a separate file or Git branch until I've graded your basic solution.

The goal of this class is to become a proficient developer;
the only way to demonstrate that is to actually submit working programs.

#### Advanced Practice

Almost every practice problem will have **advanced requirements** written out you can complete for a distinguished solution.
They are _bonus_, more difficult extensions of the practice problem.
**Do not work on them until you are done with the basic version.**

Advanced requirements sometimes require you to go beyond the taught class material at the present time to complete them.
**Super advanced requirements** always do and often times will require independent research.

### 4. Capstone

Your are required to turn in a satisfactory **capstone proposal and project**.

It is a large comprehensive project where you will demonstrate all of the skills learned.
We will go into [details about it](/notes/capstone-intro.md) later.

A capstone proposal is **satisfactory** if fulfills the [proposal requirements](/notes/capstone-proposal.md#requirements).
It is **unsatisfactory** if not.
A capstone is **satisfactory** if it fulfills the [capstone requirements](/notes/capstone-intro.md#requirements).
It is **unsatisfactory** if not.
A capstone is **distinguished** if it is satisfactory and also goes beyond the MVP proposed, shows solid understanding of all topics covered in the class, and explores topics not covered in the class.

## Distinction

This course can be passed **with distinction** if you turn in three or more distinguished checked practices, a distinguished capstone, and demonstrate a solid understanding of all topics covered in the class.

Distinction is reserved for truly cream-of-the-crop students.

## Progress Updates

I will be emailing you written progress updates at the 25%, 50%, and 75% dates throughout the course.
You'll also get a progress report upon graduation.
They'll contain a summary of:

* How I think you're progressing in the course.
* Topics I think you should continue to study.
* Your attendance record.
* Any course requirements you are not satisfying or are close to not satisfying.
