# Dependencies

You might think your program is defined by its source code.
That's only half of it.
The behavior of your program is also defined by the exact version of each module it imports.

We've already seen modules provided by the standard library.
There are also **packages** you can download which provide functionality you don't have to write.
Collectively, these other packages that you reference in your code are **dependencies**.
