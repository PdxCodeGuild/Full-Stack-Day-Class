# Dependencies

You might think your program is defined by its source code.
That's only half of it.
The behavior of your program is also defined by the exact version of each module it imports.
(And technically, the exact version of Python, OS Python is running in, and computer architecture.)

We've already seen modules provided by the standard library.
There are also **packages** you can download which provide functionality you don't have to write.
Collectively, these other packages that you reference in your code are **dependencies**.
