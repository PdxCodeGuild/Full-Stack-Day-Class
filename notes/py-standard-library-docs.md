# Standard Library Docs

Python has extensive [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) on itself.
There are three big parts you should be aware of.

## Built-In Functions

If you're looking for help on any of the basic functions that are always available, check out the [built-in functions section](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).

## Built-In Types

If you're looking for help on any of the string or list or other data structure methods, check out the [built-in types section](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html).
You'll probably want to drill down to the specific type methods you care about.

## All the Modules

If you're looking for anything else, you'll want to peruse the giant [standard library modules list](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) at the end of the index.

For now, just know that they're there.
