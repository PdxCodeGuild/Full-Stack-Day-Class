# Front-End Goals and Languages

In this class you will learn _basic_ HTML and CSS to format web pages.
**The results do not have to be pretty.**
The point of this part of the course is to learn the principles of structuring the _code_ of interfaces.
Not design.

Similar to learning Python, there is infinite depth possible.

## HTML

The **structure** of your interface is provided by HTML, **hypertext markup language**.
Notice that name, it _marks up_ existing text; it's not a procedural programming language.

## CSS

The **presentation** of your interface is provided by CSS, **cascading style sheets**.
It's also not a procedural programming language, but a **declarative** one.

It has a way of specifying how the different structures you specified in your HTML should be displayed, but not the implementation of that display.
