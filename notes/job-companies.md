# Types of Companies

There are software developers at many different types of companies.
I would stereotype them into two groups: **tech companies** and **non-tech companies**.
Here is an overview of some advantages and disadvantages to working at each as I see them.

## Tech Companies

Some companies brand themselves as **tech companies**.
They are generally places whose main product is a piece of software or service that a piece of software provides.
Think Facebook or Urban Airship or Microsoft.
They garner a lot of "cultural mindshare" surrounding what it means to be a developer.

Sometimes being a "tech company" is more of a mindset rather than being directly related to software.

* Yelp employs more salespeople than developers
* Tesla makes cars
* Amazon sells tangible things and employs more non-technical staff

Advantages:

* Developers are top of the totem pole
* Almost always work on public products used by hundreds of thousands of people
* Generally have a culture of sharing code: open source, conference talks, etc.
* Perks

Disadvantages:

* Longer hours / no set hours
* Sometimes unprofessional or poor work-life separation

## Non-Tech Companies

The _vast majority_ of developers work at **non-tech companies**.
These are places that generally have incorporated tech into their main business at a later date, even if at this point it is inseparable.
Think Wells Fargo or Walmart or Multnomah County.
Even though most developers by count work at these types of companies, they're sometimes under the radar.

Advantages:

* More professional company culture
* Can learn non-technical or non-programming skills
* More work on internal tools with slower-moving requirements

Disadvantages:

* More bureaucracy
* Possibly less work visibility
* Generally are more protective of code and property
* Might be technically under-funded or staffed (but changing as finding developers is competitive)

## Startups

New, small, fast-growth companies are **startups**.

Fresh boot camp grads will find it harder to work at a start up.
They are looking for folks who can hit the ground running and three months is too quick to feel competent in all areas.
It will depend on how the startup is technically positioning itself:
If it's going to be making money because of novel technology, they will want experienced folks.
If it's going to be making money because of a new business model or untapped market, they might be making a very simple app technically and what you learn here is enough.

Advantages:

* Get to guide culture and technology from the start
* Total independence
* Usually more stock compensation (higher compensation variability)

Disadvantages:

* Requires more breadth
* Requires lots of self-motivation
* No teachers
* Usually lower salaries

## Large Institutions

Large, established companies.

Advantages:

* Surrounded by teachers and guidance
* Great for learning established techniques
* Usually higher salaries (lower compensation variability)

Disadvantages:

* Hard to change culture or technical direction
* Usually less stock compensation
