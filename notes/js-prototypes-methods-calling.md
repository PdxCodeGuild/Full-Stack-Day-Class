# Calling Prototype Methods

Similar to [type methods](/notes/py-type-methods-calling.md), JS has **prototype methods**.
They are methods that are shared among all objects "of a type".

There are a list of a lot of them in the [standard built-in object docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects).

```js
var name = 'David';
name.startsWith('D');  //> true
```
