# Day-to-Day

The flow of the course will look like:

1. Concept Lecture
1. Demo
1. Group Practice
1. Checked Practice
1. Individual Practice?
1. Repeat

The flow of each day will look like:

1. Standup at 9:45 A.M.
1. Practice, Lecture, or Help
1. Lunch
1. More Practice, Lecture, or Help
1. Hot Tips

Every Friday I will do 15 minute one-on-ones with students individually.

## Standup

**Standup** is a quick meeting each morning at 9:45 A.M. where each person recounts to the group:

* What they worked on the previous day
* Any problems they need help resolving
* What they plan on doing today

The point of standup is to ensure that everyone is being productive and not blocked.
Feel free to directly ask others for help during this time.

Each person should take **no more than 30 seconds**.
We will literally stand to make sure you go quickly.

## Practice

The majority of the course is doing practice problems and learning-through-doing.
We will always finish each section of material with a **group practice**, then a required **checked practice**, then an optional **individual practice** for those who finish early.

During time allocated to work on practice problems, I will be coming around and answering questions and giving you informal feedback on your code.
Get my attention immediately if you do have a question.

You are welcome to share your practice solutions or help your fellow students with practice problems at any time.

### Group Practice

Group practice problems are worked on in groups of about three students.
I will assign groups such that you will work with everyone about equally throughout the course.

Please observe [good group working philosophy](/notes/group-work.md).

### Checked Practice

Checked practice problems are worked on individually and are given formal due dates.
They are part of the course requirements.
You turn them in via pushing your portfolio to GitHub.

All due dates will be listed in a class schedule link at the top of the main syllabus.

I will not tolerate direct plagiarism of checked practice code.

### Individual Practice

Individual practice problems are worked on by students who finish the checked problems before they are due or want more practice.
I will not be checking solutions, but I am happy to look at them if you ask.

## Hot Tips

About once per day I will present **hot tips**.
They are tips, reminders, and feedback to everyone in the class.
They tend to be clarifications or extensions on the formal course material that I think are necessary based on working with folks individually.

## One-on-Ones

Every Friday I will do **one-on-ones**.
They are a meeting where we can discuss anything at all.
I will come with some prepared questions, but we will also discuss whatever you want.
