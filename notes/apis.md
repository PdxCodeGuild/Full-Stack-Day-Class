# APIs

**Application Programming Interfaces** or **APIs** are a super powerful, but generic, idea.
They are the formal definition of how you access someone else's code.

You've already seen APIs:
All of the functions on the Python string class are its API.
Or all of the functions of the `random` module are its API.

The new part here is that the code might be a library on your own computer, or a web service running on many computers in a company's datacenter.

APIs that are accessed through the internet by making a HTTP request I'll call **HTTP APIs**.
E.g. Use the Google Maps API to find all of the cafes near a latitude and longitude.

APIs that are just the interface for a library to surrounding code within a single programming language I'll call **library APIs**.
E.g. Use the DOM API to manipulate a web page without jQuery.
