# Capstone Readme

One of the requirements of a finished capstone is documentation in a basic **readme**.
Commit a file called `readme.md` in your capstone repo root.

Give me a super quick rundown of how to use all the features in your app using the following rubric.
Folks you show this to (and me) haven't been sitting with this app for four weeks;
show them how to use it _concisely_.
That is a great skill to work on.

## Rubric

### Intro

Have the name of the project as the title and a two sentence explanation of the app.
And a link to your proposal.

### Setup

Are there any special running requirements other than cloning the repo and building the virtualenv with the packages in `requirements.txt`?
Any media folders I need to make or setup?
Do I need to make any Django users?
Is there default data in the DB that I need setup?
Do you have a script to do that?

**Clone your own repository in a separate directory to see what it's like to setup from scratch.**

### Usage

What are the actions I can perform, at a high level, and describe the interface to do them.
Nothing verbose, but guide me through the app.
