# Comments

If you want to write free-form information in your Python source, you can use **comments**.
They are any text after a `#`.

```py
# Anything can go here!
three = 2 + 1  # You can put it after real Python, too!
```

Comments after code should have _two spaces_ before the `#`.

Use comments to:

1. Remind yourself how a section of code works.
1. Disable one version of code you're trying out to compare to another version.
1. As a todo list for things you need to fill in later.
