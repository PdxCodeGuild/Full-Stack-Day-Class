# Front-End Tools

For this section of the class, you will be required to use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as your development web browser.
Even if you are more familiar with other browsers in your day-to-day, please use Chrome for solving the problems in this course.

Although it's getting better, there are lots of inconsistencies between the different browsers.
Learning how to deal with that is not the topic of this class.
