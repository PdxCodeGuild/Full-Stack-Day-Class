# Functions as Structure

Just like variables and their names help in understanding how a program works, functions and their names can be used to help in the same way.

Make **each step** in your program a separate function.
There is no shame in using a function only once.

* Functions have names and so code explains itself.
* You can call and test each part in isolation without running the whole program easily.
* Highlights generality; you can see steps that almost repeat each other and more easily see similarities.
