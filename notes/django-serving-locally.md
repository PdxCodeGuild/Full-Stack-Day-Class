# Serving Locally

Django includes a web server that knows how to run your view code in response to HTTP requests.

From inside your virtualenv, run `runserver`.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start a server on <http://localhost:8000/>.

`localhost` or `127.0.0.1` are the hostname and address that refer to your machine.
