# Programming Philosophy
Programming is an exercise in being super anal and super flexible _simultaneously_.
It is like assembling LEGOs;
they only fit together in certain ways on the small scale, but there are infinite possibilities in the large.

Be prepared to be more exacting then you have every been, but also more open minded than you have ever been.
