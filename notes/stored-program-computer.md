# Stored Program Computer

When a computer does work, it is following a saved recipe.
That recipe is saved in a **file**.
That file contains the **source code** for the program.

In this section of the course, the source code will be written in Python.
It is a **programming language**.
It is very specific textual instructions for the computer.

The whole goal of this class is to generate carefully crafted files that know how to solve specific problems.
