# Basic Problem Solving

It starts out intimidating to write code from scratch to solve a problem.
Think about these things before you start working on it.

1.  Think of your nouns.
    Your nouns will be variables.

1.  Think about what data types will let you perform those steps easily.

Then _aggressively_ break your problem down into these steps and work on them one at a time.

## 1. Setup

Set any constants that are fixed with every run.

## 2. Input

Get data from your user.
Save it in variables.

## 3. Transform

Do work!
Solve your problem!
Transform your input values into output values.

Avoid printing here.
It is confusing to keep track values if you're printing them out and they're changing.

## 4. Output

Print out labeled answers that came from your transform step.
