# Entity-Relation Diagrams
**Entity-relation diagrams** are a way of visually mapping out the nouns in your project and figuring out your data model.

Think of every top-level noun.
Then think of all of the things it "contains".
If they're simple things, they can be just a field.
If there are complex things, they should be another entity.
