# Capstone Introduction
Let me formally introduce the most exciting part of this course: the **capstone**!
This is your _big final project_ for your portfolio.
It will be the deliverable that you get to _show off to prospective employers_.

**This is the most important part of this class.**
Once it begins around week 9, the tone of the class will shift from being a classroom setting, to more of a co-working space with me and each other as a resource.

## Schedule
The formal schedule for working on your capstone is:
* End of Week 6 2016-04-27: Proposal due at end of day
* Mid Week 7: Approved proposal
* Week 9: Class becomes just capstone work
* Memorial Day 2016-05-30: No Class
* Last Day of Class 2016-06-09: Capstone show-and-tell
* End of Last Day of Class 2016-06-09: Capstone due at end of day

Even after the capstone has been "due", you should continue to work on it.
PDX Code Guild will setup a demo day for recruiters at Portland area.

* 3-4 Weeks after Last Class: Demo Day for Recruiters

Demo day for the previous day class will be on 2016-04-25.

From this point forward, if you finish projects early, please work on your capstone (as many of you already have).
Brainstorm ideas, plan out implementations, etc.

## Project Requirements
Your capstone _must_ at least touch upon all of the major areas in the course that we cover.
* Python
* Django
* Databases
* JS
* HTML
* CSS
* Documentation (docstrings, read me)
* Testing
* Proper language style

I will reject project proposals that do not have the ability to touch upon all of these areas.

You are encouraged to _dive deep_ in areas of your interest.
Commitment and striving for mastery in a topic area is appreciated by prospective employers.
