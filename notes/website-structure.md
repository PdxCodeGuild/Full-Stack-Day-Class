# Website Structure

A **website** is a series of resources that work together to get something done.
**Resources** are pages, images, style information, data, any _noun_.

Resources are identified by their URL or location.
Your web browser knows how to parse the URL and then **request** the data for the resource from the appropriate web server.

The structure of a website is up to you.
There are lots of different ways to use HTML, HTTP, and browsers to make a website that does the right thing.
