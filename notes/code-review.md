# Code Review

You are going to do a group **code review**.
The purpose of code review is to get feedback and improve your own code.
Code is read by others much more than it is written by you.

Spend 20 minutes going through each person's code.
They should give a brief tour of the big moving parts.
Reviewers should try to understand the existing code.
Then others should critically ask questions to understand why they structured their code as they did.
The focus is first on _question-asking_.
Reviewee should try to see what parts of their own code are easy and hard to understand and why that is the case.

Take notes on what other people are confused about in your project.

Once the basic understanding is done, reviewers should provide some suggestions for clarifying code.
Provide _constructive feedback on the code_.
They are just suggestions, though, no need to fully agree with them or implement them.
