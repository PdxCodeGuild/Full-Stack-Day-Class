# Semantic Elements
HTML has been around for a long time and has had to be very backwards-compatible.
There are many elements that should be considered deprecated because they don't have to do with content or structure, but instead have to do with style.

Avoid using elements that specify style or layout.
* `center`
* `font`
* `strike`
* `b`
* `i`
* `u`
