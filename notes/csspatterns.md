# CSS Patterns
Here are some starter tips for planning out and writing your CSS.

* Start with just element selectors; set style defaults
* Style the `html` if you want something to apply to everything
* Come up with "consistent exceptions" to those and make classes
* Classes can be **mixins**; sets of attributes you want to apply arbitrarily to elements, e.g. "warning"
* Use unique ID for specific single exceptions on the page; avoid these
* Avoid using IDs for elements that are already unique: `html`, `body`, if your page contains a single `header`
