# Job Searching

Most jobs are found through connections, not through cold calling or resume sending.

Tap into your literal social network.
Do your friends, family, sports teammates, hobby acquaintances, former classmates, etc. work at a place that is hiring technical talent?
Remember, most developers _don't_ work at "tech companies".

Set up informational coffee / beer dates.
**People love to talk about themselves.**
Take advantage of this.
Phrase your request as inquisitive and personally-focused.

> Could I get you a beer sometime and hear about what you do at your job?

You'll be surprised at how easy it is to get people to meet with you.

You can build your social network.
Go to [meet ups](http://calagator.org) and chat it up with folks.
Ask questions.
Again, people love to talk about themselves.

When you are comparing a job description with your own skills, look at **high-level skills** not low-level ones.
You have experience with Python and Django; you could work at a place that does Ruby and Rails.
There are a good number of transferrable concepts, if not syntax.
You also have project ownership and self-direction skills that are widely desired.

Once you've met with someone for an informational interview, later you can ask them specifically about if they know if the company is hiring technical talent and if they can refer you.

Also realize that many tech companies give out referral bonuses.
It's possible that your friends might get a few thousand dollars if they refer you and are hired.
As part of that process, remind them that that might be the case!
