# Basic Math

Python gives you all of the basic math operators.

```py
4 + 2  #> 6
5 - 9  #> -4
12 / 5  #> 2.4
4 * 5  #> 20
```

It also gives you some stranger ones.

Floor division divides then throws away the remainder.

```py
12 // 5  #> 2
```

Exponentiation takes a number to a power.

```py
3 ** 2  #> 9
```

Many of [Python's built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) are related to simple math.

* `max(a, b)` returns the larger of `a` or `b`
* `min` same thing
* `abs` returns the absolute value of a Numbers
* `pow(base, exp)` returns a number to a power
