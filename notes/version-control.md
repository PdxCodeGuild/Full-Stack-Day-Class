# Version Control

Any code project evolves over time.
New features are added, bugs are introduced and fixed, more people start collaborating on the code.

**Version control** is tooling to track every change inside a directory.

Why would you want this?

* History --
Find the change that introduced a bug.
Undo bad changes.
See differences between any two versions.
* Collaborate --
Edit the same code and have the tool check to see if you're stepping on each other's toes.
* Multitask --
Work on multiple separate features in parallel, without flipping comments.
* Backup --
Easily replicate the history of a project on another computer.
In case of fire.

Even if it's just _you_ writing a simple script, _use it_.

We will use [Git](/notes/git-basic.md) as our version control system of choice.
