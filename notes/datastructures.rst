Picking Data Structures
=======================

===== ======= ======== =======
Type  Length? Ordered? Lookup?
===== ======= ======== =======
List   Yes    Yes      No
Dict   Yes    No       Yes
Set    Yes    No       No
===== ======= ======== =======

There is *no shame* in converting between data structures within a single problem.
There is no perfect data structure that answers all of your questions, so

Think Dict When
---------------

- Table
- Lookup
- Mapping
- Aggregation -- Dict of lists

Think Set When
--------------

- Contains
- Unique
- "In this not in that"

Think List When
---------------

- Order
- Queue
- Line
- Count items
- "I have no idea" -- lists are a good default
