# Capstone Submission

Your capstone is due at 11:59 P.M. on the last day of class.
To submit it, have a complete version pushed to GitHub under the branch `master` by then.

You are turning in a finished product.
Do not include any extraneous or incomplete work in your `master` branch.
If there is prototype work, save it somewhere else or work on it in a separate branch.

I already have your capstone repo names from when you submitted your proposals.

I will grade them over the three business days after they are due and will email you feedback and your graduation status.
