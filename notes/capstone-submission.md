# Capstone Submission

Your capstone is due at 11:59 P.M. on the last day of class.
To submit it, have a complete version pushed to GitHub by then.

I already have your capstone repo names from when you submitted your proposals.

I will grade them over the three business days after they are due and will email you feedback and your graduation status.
