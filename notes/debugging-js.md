# JS Debugging

First, take to heart the ideas in the [advanced debugging notes](/notes/debugging-adv.md).

JS is very "forgiving".
It will run lots of "incorrect" code without errors, and instead silently return things like `undefined`.

* Double check all of your inputs.
* Use intermediate variables to allow you to see values in the debugger.
* Run functions in isolation using the console.
* Practice using the object explorer.
