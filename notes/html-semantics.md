# Semantic Elements

Try to use the most semantically appropriate element.
It helps someone who is reading your code to understand the purpose of different blocks in a uniform way.
It also helps write CSS that is easier to read later.

E.g. use `nav` instead of a generic `div`.

## Avoid Style Elements

HTML has been around for a long time and has had to be very backwards-compatible.
There are many elements that should be considered deprecated because they have to do with style instead of semantics.

* `center`
* `font`
* `strike`
* `b`
* `i`
* `u`

Avoid using elements that specify style or layout.
