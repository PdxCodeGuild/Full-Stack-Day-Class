# Capstone Proposal
We will be setting aside the entire day that the proposal is due to work on it.
**Start work on it before then.**

## Rubric
Please answer all of the following areas in your proposal.
I will be evaluating that your capstone fulfill all [the requirements](capstoneintro.md#projectrequirements) and can be completed in a timely fashion by you.
I am _not_ evaluating the business savvy of your project (although I'd be happy to give my two cents, if you ask).

I only require a text document.
Feel free to hand draw mockups and include them if that helps you plan or if the concepts are complicated.

### Name
What is the short name of your product or project?

### High-Level Product
What is your web app going to do?
How does a user interact with it on a high level?

### Specific Functionality
What is _every_ specific page or interface and _every_ action the user can take?

**Pick the minimum feature set for your product to work.**
You can always add more features if you get "done" early.

### Technical Components
What are the "moving parts"?
What are the "modules" you're going to write?

This is _more specific_ than "Django backend, CSS style, etc."
Please specify what specific technical problems you'll have to solve and a guess at the solution, e.g. "a Python module that uses the pillow library to combine two images at half opacity; a database table and Django model that work together to store, retrieve, and search existing images by name".

### Timeline
In what order will you tackle your technical components?
Can you guess how long you'll take for each?
What are the easy parts?
What are the hard parts?

Work on the tough and crucial parts first.

## Submission
Create a _new_ git repo based on your project name [in GitHub](https://github.com/new).
Init that repository with a readme.
Write up your proposal as `proposal.md` and link to it from the readme.
I don't care that you learn all of the fancy parts of [writing Markdown documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/), but just get some basic sections that tackle the rubric above.

Message me with a link to your capstone repo before the proposal is due.
