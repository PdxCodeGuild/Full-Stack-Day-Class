# Capstone Proposal
We will be setting aside the entire day that the proposal is due to work on it.
**Start work on it before then.**

## Rubric
Please address all of the following areas in your proposal **for your MVP**.
I will be evaluating that your capstone fulfill all [the requirements](capstoneintro.md#projectrequirements) and can be completed in a timely fashion by you.
I am _not_ evaluating the business savvy of your project (although I'd be happy to give my two cents, if you ask).

I only require a text document.
Feel free to hand draw mockups and include them if that helps you plan or if the concepts are complicated.

Please look at the [demo proposal](../demos/proposal.md).

### Name
Give your product or project a simple, short name.

### Product Overview
What is your web app going to do?
How does a user interact with it on a high level?

### Specific Functionality
What is _every_ specific page or interface and _every_ action the user can take?

**Pick the minimum feature set for your product to work.**
Everything else should go in the "further work" section.

### Data Model
What are the "nouns" in your project?
What do they represent?
What do you need to save in the DB?
What are the specific fields on each?

How do you need to _search_ for specific instances of nouns?

### Technical Components
What are the "moving parts" of your MVP?
What are the things like "modules" you're going to write?
How do they talk to each other?

This is _more specific_ than "Django backend, CSS style, etc."
Please specify what specific technical problems you'll have to solve and a guess at the solution.

### Schedule
Write out the order in which you will tackle your technical components of your MVP.

What are the easy parts?
What are the hard parts?
Can you guess how long you'll take for each?

Work on the tough and crucial parts first.

### Further Work
All of the above parts are just addressing your MVP.
Here you should outline other features you'd like to implement if you get "done" early.
Order them by importance towards your high-level goal and what order you'll work on them later.

Don't work on any of these features until **all of MVP is complete**.

## Submission
Create a _new_ git repo based on your project name [in GitHub](https://github.com/new).
Init that repository with a readme.
Write up your proposal as `proposal.md` and link to it from the readme.
I don't care that you learn all of the fancy parts of [writing Markdown documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/), but just get some basic sections that tackle the rubric above.

Message me with a link to your capstone repo before the proposal is due.
