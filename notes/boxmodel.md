# Box Model
The **box model** is the basis for how elements are sized and laid out.

Every element has a:
* Width and height -- core size of inner content
* Padding -- extra space between core and border
* Border -- visible outline of some thickness
* Margin -- extra space between border and neighboring elements

Margins overlap.
They are like specifying a minimum distance between elements.

Width and height by default are just big enough to contain the contents.
You can override this. with a fixed width.

## Block vs Inline
Block elements arraged vertically in order.
They take up as much space as possible by default.

Inline elements flow like words. They wrap inside the parent element.
