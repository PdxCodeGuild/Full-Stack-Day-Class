# Post-Course Work

**Your learning should not end once the class is over!**
You have learned the basics, but continuing your education is necessary to become more competitive in the job market.
The first _two years_ of being a junior web developer will be paced as this class was.

Find ways to keep educating yourself.

* Do more independent work on your capstone
* Attend coding meet-ups
* Contribute to an open source project
* Use coding to solve small day-to-day problems
* Start another large project

Use those "excuses" learn more technical skills.

* Different web frameworks and languages (Java / Dropwizard, Ruby / Rails, Go)
* Unit, integration, contract testing
* Advanced Git or version control (Mercurial)
* Systems programming (C, C++, Rust)
* Data analysis (R, Pandas, NumPy, Matlab, Scala)
* Machine Learning (SVM, K-Means, Decision Trees, etc.)
* Distributed data processing (Hadoop, Kafka, Storm, Scalding)
* Front-end frameworks (AngularJS, React)
* Shell scripting, administration, and advanced command line tools (bash, sed, awk)
* Mobile development (iOS: Swift, Objective-C, Android: Java)
* Database types and interfaces (SQL, NoSQL, Elasticsearch, Cassandra)
* Game programming (C, C++, D, OpenGL, Unity and C#)
* Service oriented architectures (Docker, Kubernetes, Zipkin)
* Security techniques (fuzzing, Valgrind)
* Unified front-back-end architectures (Clojure / ClojureScript, Node / JavaScript, Meteor)
* Cloud Deployment and Ecosystems (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure)
* "Serverless Apps" (AWS Lambda)
* Blockchain / Distributed Storage / Computation (Bitcoin, Ethereum, IPFS)
