# Post-Course Work

**Your learning should not end once the class is over!**
You have learned the basics, but continuing your education is necessary to become more competitive in the job market.
The first _two years_ of being a junior web developer will be paced as this class was.

Find ways to keep educating yourself.

* Do more independent work on your capstone
* Attend coding meet-ups
* Contribute to an open source project
* Use coding to solve small day-to-day problems
* Start another large project

Using those "excuses" learn more technical skills.

* Unit, integration, contract testing
* Advanced Git
* Another programming language (Java, Ruby, C, OCaml, etc.)
* Front-end frameworks (AngularJS, React, etc.)
* Shell scripting and advanced command line tools (bash, grep, sed, etc.)
* Mobile development
* Database types and interfaces (SQL, NoSQL, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, etc.)
* Graphics library programming
* Service oriented architectures
* Security techniques

As a graduate of Code Guild, you are welcome to:

* Email me at any time for assistance
* Use the public Code Guild facilities as a workspace
* Come to our demo days and public code meet-ups
