# Stubbing
**Stubbing** is writing out function definitions without filling in the body, just to feel the structure of your code.
I think of it as "coding by making believe".

Start by defining a real main function and calling pretend functions for each one of the steps you'll think you have in your problem.
```py

```

Then add definitions for those pretend functions you just used.
In them, write out code that comes to mind, or use more pretend functions for steps in that sub-problem.
```py

```

Repeat this process until all of your functions are real code!
