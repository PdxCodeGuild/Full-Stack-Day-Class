# Demo Day

Three to four weeks after class ends, Code Guild will set up a public **demo day** for you to show off your completed capstone to friends, family, other class' students, industry engineers, recruiters, and hiring mangers.

Presenting at demo day is not a requirement to get a certificate from the course, but **we highly encourage it**.
Spending the time between the end of class and demo day further expanding and polishing your project is great continuing practice.
No need to present on just your MVP you turned in for credit in the class; please talk about advanced features you had the time to add afterward.
The goal of this is to show off!

You'll have five minutes for a short formal presentation about your capstone, and then there will be five minutes of Q&A.
Five minutes is spectacularly short, so be _focused_ and _concise_.
There are no requirements for the presentation, although most people prepare a short PowerPoint, then go to a live demo.
Try to tell the story of your product or of your education through it:

* What does your project do?
* Can you show it to me?
* Why are you interested in it?
* What skills, technical and personal, did you learn?
* What challenges did you overcome?
* What do you want to move into?
