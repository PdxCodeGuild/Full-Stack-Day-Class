# Bootstrap
If you're not interested in writing your CSS from scratch, you can use existing CSS framework.
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) is a well-known one.

Because it has to be _very general_ it is _very opinionated_ on how your HTML has to be structured.
That breaks the "HTML is structure and meaning" vs "CSS is presentation" divide.
I would only recommend using it if you are making a small site that you just needs some relatively clean design.
