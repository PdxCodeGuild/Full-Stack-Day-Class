# MVP

An **MVP** is a **minimum viable product**.
It is the core idea of your product or project.
_Nothing else_.

Your capstone needs to start as an MVP.
Even if you have grand dreams about working on your capstone full-time later, the first pass should just be this core idea.

Be _very_ judicious in the scope of your project.
**Projects are much more time consuming than you think.**

Anything that's beyond your MVP is still a good idea!
Definitely still write it down and work on it _later_.

## Hints

*   Be very specific.
    Pick a single data set or specific function, even if you have dreams about multiple ones.

*   Avoid "users" or "logins" unless it is actually critical to your site.
    90% of MVPs don't need logins for the core idea.

*   Avoid _Numpy_ and _Scipy_.
    They are a bitch to get running.
    See if you can other pure-Python packages that implement what you're looking for.
