# CSS in Atom

We will be using Atom to edit our front-end CSS code.

Install the following packages:

* [linter-stylelint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-stylelint)

Then save [the config that enforces our style](/.stylelintrc.js) in `.stylelintrc.js` in your `codeguild/` directory.
Note, this is a hidden file.
The package will automatically pick up the configuration in that file.
