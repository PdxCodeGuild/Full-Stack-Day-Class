# Types of Companies

There are software developers at many different types of companies.
Here is an overview of them and advantages and disadvantages to working at each as I see them.

## Tech Companies

Some companies brand themselves as **tech companies**.
They are generally places whose main product is a piece of software.
Think Facebook or Urban Airship or Microsoft.

Sometimes being a "tech company" is more of a mindset.

* Yelp employs more salespeople than developers
* Tesla makes cars
* Amazon sells tangible things and employs more non-technical staff

### Advantages

* Developers are top of the totem pole
* Almost always work on public products used by hundreds of thousands of people
* Generally have a culture of sharing code
* Perks

### Disadvantages

* Longer hours / no set hours
* Sometimes unprofessional or poor work-life separation

## Non-Tech Companies

The _vast majority_ of developers work at **non-tech companies**.
These are places that generally have incorporated tech into their main business at a later date, even if at this point it is inseparable.
Think Wells Fargo or Walmart or Multnomah County.

### Advantages

* More professional company culture
* Can learn non-technical or non-programming skills
* Work on internal tools with slower-moving requirements

### Disadvantages

* More bureaucracy
* Less work visibility
* Generally are more protective of code and property
* Might be under-funded or staffed (but changing as developers are competitive)

## Startups

New, small, fast-growth companies are **startups**.

### Advantages

* Get to guide culture and technology from the start
* Total independence
* Usually more stock compensation

### Disadvantages

* Requires a lot of breadth
* Requires lots of self-motivation
* No teachers
* Usually lower salaries

## Large Institutions

Large, established companies.

### Advantages

* Surrounded by teachers and guidance
* Great for learning established techniques
* Usually higher salaries

### Disadvantages

* Hard to change culture or technical direction
* Usually less stock compensation
