# Negotiation

You're going to be given an offer!
Great!

Now it's time to play capitalist.

The definition of an employee:

1. You do work.
1. They pay you.

There is _nothing_ you are more entitled to negotiate or ask about than how much you are paid.

**Don't be afraid to ask for anything.**
The worst they can say is "no".
They want you to work there at this point!
They won't rescind your offer because you ask for something they can't give, they just won't give it.
