# Negotiation

First realize that an employer has the upper hand in negotiation.
They know how much every other employee at the company makes, and probably have a sense of how much employees at other companies make.
Don't reveal your cards.

If they ask about salary at _any_ point before you have an offer, delay discussing specifics.

> Them: What kind of salary are you looking to make in this position?
>
> You: I'd like to hold off discussing compensation until we're both sure that I'm the right fit for this role and your company.

But once you do have an offer, great!
Now it's time to play capitalist.

The definition of an employee:

1. You do work.
1. They pay you.

There is _nothing_ you are more entitled to negotiate or ask about than how much you are paid.

**Don't be afraid to ask for anything.**
The worst they can say is "no".
They want you to work there at this point!
They won't rescind your offer because you ask for something they can't give, they just won't give it.
It's a lot more work to interview someone else than to say "no".

At this point, still don't reveal your cards.
Ask to know what the salary range for the position is.
Companies will have an idea of how much they are willing to compensate for that position.

> Them: What kind of salary are you looking to make in this position?
>
> You: What the salary range you have allocated for this position?

That kind of direct question is hard to work around.
