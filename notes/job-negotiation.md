# Negotiation

The definition of an employee:

1. You do work.
1. They pay you.

There is _nothing_ you are more entitled to negotiate or ask about than how much you are paid.

First realize that an employer has the upper hand in negotiation.
They know how much every other employee at the company makes, and probably have a sense of how much employees at other companies make.
Don't reveal your cards.

If they ask about salary at _any_ point before you have an offer, delay discussing specifics.

> Them: What kind of salary are you looking to make in this position?
>
> You: I'd like to hold off discussing compensation until we're both sure that I'm the right fit for this role and your company.

But once you do have an offer, great!
Now it's time to live out capitalism.

**Don't be afraid to ask for anything.**
The worst they can do is say is "no".
They want you to work there at this point!
They have _already invested money in interviewing you_.
It's more work and money to interview someone else than to say "no".
They won't rescind your offer because you ask for something they can't give, they just won't give it.

If they still ask you what your salary range is when making you an offer, don't reveal.
Ask to know what the salary range for the position is.
Companies will have an idea of how much they are willing to compensate for that position as part of their bookkeeping.

> Them: What kind of salary are you looking to make in this position?
>
> You: What the salary range you have allocated for this position?

That kind of direct question is hard to work around.
They might not have the answer right on hand, but you can wait to hear it.

Also realize that there are lots of parts to your compensation that you can ask and trade off:

* Salary / Hourly Rate
* Stock Options
* Restricted Stock
* Working Hours
* Working Days
* Remote / Work from Home Days
* Other Benefits (opt out of employer health insurance and buy your own, etc.)

Negotiate all of these things to get what you want.

Also realize that you can re-negotiate these things once you've been working for a while.
I know folks who have re-negotiated to working from home one day a week.
Remember, it is much more expensive and uncertain for them to lose you, hire someone new, and train them, over keeping you at a lower productivity.
