# Googling for Solutions

Before asking me for help, you should search the internet on your own for help.
People have asked and answered many questions on the internet already.

1. Think of an English, slightly abstract description of your problem.
1. Add "python" to the beginning.

Examples:

> python sorting a dictionary by value
>
> python interleaving two lists
>
> python picking out last item
>
> python join list of ints by comma

This is a skill to practice, just like coding.

While you're breaking your problem down, if there's an operation you wish you had, google for it and see if someone has written an easy version of it.
Don't just google complete problems.

## StackOverflow

Many results will be to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com).
It's a programming-centric Q&A site.

People vote on what answers are best.
Only really look at the _top answer_.
Many are, quite frankly, shit.

## Python 2

May of the responses on websites are written in Python 2 and won't run unmodified on the Python 3 interpreter we're using.
I've written up a [short list of big changes](/notes/py-using2.md) that you can keep and use to convert example code you find.
