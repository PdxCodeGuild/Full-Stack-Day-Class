# Resume Writing

Convince me in one page that you are probably what I'm looking for.

It is a persuasive piece.
Demonstrate how your experiences make you fit the role you are applying for.
Include an "objective".
You want to communicate if you're looking for a full-time or contract or remote job.

It must be brief.
I had to read 30 at a time.
If you can't convince me in one page you're interesting, you're done.
Pick the most relevant things.

Describe high-level skills more than products or technologies.
I'm looking for skills and teachability, not someone who has built a specific solution, usually.

Be realistic and truthful when describing your skills.
It's fine to say that you're a "beginner in CSS" if you think you are.
Don't say you're an "expert in Python" if you aren't.

Most tech places will only check references as a final "sanity check" step.
That might be different with other types of companies, but that's my experience.
Thus, no need to have references supplied right off the bat.
