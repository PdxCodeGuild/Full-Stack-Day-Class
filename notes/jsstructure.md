# Basic JS Structure
Here is an outline you can use to start working on your JS interface code.
Write functions that do the following:

1. Get input from the user from input boxes
1. Create new elements from some input
1. Select the existing elements you want to change (style, attaching new elements, etc.)
1. "Main" functions that perform all of those tasks in order for each action
1. Event handler functions that will call those main functions when the correct event happens
