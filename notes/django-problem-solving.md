# Django Problem Solving
When starting a Django problem from scratch, use the following steps to get started.

## 1. Make Application
Follow [the steps to make a Python application](py-app-structure.md).

## 2. Init Django Files
Run the [Django init script](django-init.md) to create the bare-bones Django Python files.
Commit them.

## 3. Write Views
Create a `views.py` in your application root with [views](django-views.md) and make a function for each page.

## 4. Route
[Create routes](django-routes.md) for each of your views.

## 5. Run Server
[Run your server locally](django-serving-locally.md) and see if you can get the views to load.

## 5. Write Logic
Now you can actually flesh out the logic of your app that is called from the view functions.
