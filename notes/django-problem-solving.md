# Django Problem Solving
When starting a Django problem from scratch, use the following steps to get started.

## 1. Make Application
Follow [the steps to make a Python application](/notes/py-app-structure.md).
[Install](/notes/py-pip.md) the Django package in your virtualenv.

## 2. Init Django Files
Follow the steps to initialize a [Django project](/notes/django-init.md).
Commit all the resulting files.

## 3. Write Views
[Create view functions](/notes/django-views.md) for each page.

## 4. Route
[Create routes](/notes/django-routes.md) for each of your views.

## 5. Write Logic
Work on your [core program logic](/notes/django-logic.md) in modules that don't use Django.

## 6. Run Server
[Run your server locally](/notes/django-serving-locally.md) and see if you can get the views to load.

## 7. Write Logic
Now you can actually flesh out the logic of your app that is called from the view functions.
