# Git Basic Workflow

1. Make changes using your editor to the working directory.
1. Stage those changes in the index using `git add FILES...`.
1. Commit those staged changes in the index to your local history using `git commit`.
1. Push those new commits in your local history to the default remote history using `git push`.
