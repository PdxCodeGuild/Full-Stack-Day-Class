# Interviewing

You will be evaluated by mostly your future peers.
These people will not be trained HR or managers.
You'll have to answer technical questions, social questions, and placate some random person, basically.

Usually there is a hierarchy of interviews:

1. Resume screen
1. Phone screen
1. Phone / Skype interview(s)
1. On-site interviews

Each increases in length and intensity.

I was told to evaluate candidates on:

* Knowing what they claim to know; resume as talking points
* Demonstrating working through difficulty; no need to be perfect on first try!
* Understanding tradeoffs of material / knowing what you don't know
* Seeming to work with you, rather than for you or against you
* Having an interest in learning the content that the company is working on
* Would you want to work next to this person?

Sometimes you will have whiteboard coding problems, sometimes collaborative document editing, sometimes pair programming.

Avoid talking about compensation until you are given an offer and can negotiate.
Often the person interviewing is not in a position to know or discuss that, so it is awkward.
