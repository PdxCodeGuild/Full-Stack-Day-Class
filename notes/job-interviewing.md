# Interviewing

You will be evaluated by mostly your future peers.
These people will not be trained HR or managers.
You'll have to answer technical questions, social questions, and placate some random person, basically.

Usually there is a hierarchy of interviews:

1. Phone screen
1. Phone / Skype interview(s)
1. On-site interviews

Each increases in length and intensity.

I was told to evaluate candidates on:

* Knowing what they claim to know
* Demonstrating working through difficulty; no need to be perfect on first try!
* Understanding tradeoffs of material
* Seeming to work with you, rather than for you or against you
* Having an interest in learning the content that the company is working on
* Would you want to work next to this person?

Sometimes you will have whiteboard coding problems, sometimes collaborative document editing, sometimes pair programming.

Avoid talking about compensation until you are given an offer and can negotiate.
Even if they directly ask you.
You can always say,

> Them: What kind of salary are you looking to make in this position?
>
> You: I'd like to hold off discussing compensation until we're both sure that I'm the right fit for this role and your company.
