# Stored Program Computer
Your computer uses the **stored program model**.
This means the instructions for each program are stored as _files_ on the hard drive.

When you are writing Python code, you create a `.py` file that stores all the instructions.
You then tell the computer to later **execute** that code.
It will follow the instructions, but this time on whatever _new input_ it gets from the user that time.
