# REPL

If you run `python` without any source file to execute, you will be dropped into an interactive prompt or **read, evaluate, print loop** or **REPL**.
This allows you to run arbitrary Python code line by line and try out and experiment.

**This is an amazing power and you should use it!**
Make sure your mental model is what you expect.

## BPython

Better than just running `python` is [Better Python](http://bpython-interpreter.org).
It is a REPL that provides awesome tab completion, docstring reveals, and syntax highlighting.

It's not part of the main Python install, but is easy to do so with Pip.

```bash
pip install bpython
```

You can then run it with `bpython` on the command line.
