# MVP
An **MVP** is a **minimum viable product**.
It is the core idea of your product or project.
_Nothing else_.

Be _very_ judicious in the scope of your project.
Projects are much harder than you think.

## Hints
* Don't be generic.
Pick a single data set or specific function, even if you have dreams about multiple ones.
* Avoid "users" or "logins" unless it is actually critical to your site.
90% of MVPs don't actually need logins.
* Avoid _Numpy_ and _Scipy_.
They are a bitch to get running.
See if you can other pure-Python packages that implement what you're looking for.
