# Encapsulation

Classes version of functions being contracts.
One person can work on implementation. One person can work on use.
They agree on a contract, they don't need to worry directly about each other's work.

The functions in a class can define a contract.
Then the person that uses the functions doesn't care about the data structures directly.

Short form of class method calling is cool!
You don't have to know the exact class that the instance has.

## Private Naming Convention

Prefix a variable name with underscore to say it's not meant to be read.
But no one is stopping you...
