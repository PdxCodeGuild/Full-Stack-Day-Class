# JS Style

There is not one consistent style guide for the language.
In this class, we will use the [Google JS style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml).

Read it and follow its guidance.

Quick summary:

* Blocks are indented two spaces.
* Always use `var`.
* Always use semicolons `;` at the end of each statement.
* Curly braces `{}` are on the same line as the opening declaration.

Make sure your [JS linter](/notes/atom-js.md) is working properly in Atom.
