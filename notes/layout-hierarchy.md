# Hierarchical Layout

Use the hierarchy of your HTML to _isolate_ layout interactions.
Take advantage of the [default block element layout](/notes/layout-default.md).

Make container elements for each section of your page, and make as many sections as you need.
You can then work on getting the section containers laid out correctly before moving in and working on getting their contents laid out correctly.

Again, work from the top-down.

If you keep your HTML flat, you have lots of different interactions between siblings to deal with, which is hard.
