# Capstone Introduction

Let me formally introduce the most exciting part of this course: the **capstone**!
This is your _big final project_ for your portfolio.
It will be the deliverable that you get to _show off to prospective employers_.

**This is the most important part of this class.**

## Idea

Start thinking of a project or product that you'd like to make as a web application.
Your goal is to come up with an [MVP](/notes/capstone-mvp.md) of your idea.

If you're having trouble coming up with an idea, let me know _now_.
I suggest thinking of a problem _you_ have in your day-to-day that you might be able to solve.

## Requirements

Your capstone _must_ demonstrate understanding of all of the major topics in the course, incorporated into a _cohesive_ single web app.
Merely using topic does not automatically constitute "understanding";
the use must contribute to the project meaningfully, show why the topic is useful, and demonstrate its usage via the methods taught in this class.

* Python language basics
* Django models for persistent storage
* Use of Django templating and views
* Design of reasonable Django routes
* Incorporating user input to views
* Isolated Python logic layer
* Javascript language basics
* jQuery DOM manipulation and event handling
* Semantic HTML structure
* CSS style and layout
* Code structuring techniques throughout
* Documentation via relevant comments, docstrings, and a [readme](/notes/capstone-readme.md)
* Unit testing of functional parts
* Proper language style throughout

I will reject project proposals that do not have the ability to show understanding of all of these topic areas.

You are encouraged to _dive deep_ in areas of your interest.
Commitment and striving for mastery in a topic area is appreciated by prospective employers.

## Schedule

The formal schedule for working on your capstone is:

* End of Week 6: [Proposal](/notes/capstone-proposal.md) due at end of day
* Mid Week 7: Approved proposal
* Week 9: Class becomes just capstone work
* Last Day of Class: Capstone [show-and-tell](/notes/capstone-show-and-tell.md)
* End of Last Day of Class: Capstone due at end of day

Even after the capstone has been "due", you should continue to work on it.
PDX Code Guild will setup a demo day for the public.

* 3-4 Weeks after Last Class: [Demo Day](/notes/capstone-demo-day.md) for Recruiters

From this point forward, if you finish projects early, please work on your capstone (as many of you already have).
Brainstorm ideas, plan out implementations, etc.

We will be setting aside the entire day that the proposal is due to work on it.
Start work on it before then.

As you do any work on your capstone, push it to its GitHub repo.
It's an easy way to backup your work and it's how you'll turn it in.

Once it begins around week 9, the tone of the class will shift from being a classroom setting, to more of a co-working space with me and each other as a resource.
