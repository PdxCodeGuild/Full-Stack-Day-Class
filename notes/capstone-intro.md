# Capstone Introduction

Let me formally introduce the most exciting part of this course: the **capstone**!
This is your _big final project_ for your portfolio.
It will be the deliverable that you get to _show off to prospective employers_.

**This is the most important part of this class.**

## Idea

Start thinking of a project or product that you'd like to make as a web application.
Your goal is to come up with an [MVP](/notes/capstone-mvp.md) of your idea.

If you're having trouble coming up with an idea, let me know _now_.
I suggest thinking of a problem _you_ have in your day-to-day that you might be able to solve.

## Schedule

The formal schedule for working on your capstone is:

* End of Week 6: [Proposal](/notes/capstone-proposal.md) due at end of day
* Mid Week 7: Approved proposal
* Week 9: Class becomes just capstone work
* Last Day of Class: Capstone [show-and-tell](/notes/capstone-show-and-tell.md)
* End of Last Day of Class: Capstone due at end of day

Even after the capstone has been "due", you should continue to work on it.
PDX Code Guild will setup a demo day for the public.

* 3-4 Weeks after Last Class: [Demo Day](/notes/capstone-demo-day.md) for Recruiters

From this point forward, if you finish projects early, please work on your capstone (as many of you already have).
Brainstorm ideas, plan out implementations, etc.

We will be setting aside the entire day that the proposal is due to work on it.
Start work on it before then.

As you do any work on your capstone, push it to its GitHub repo.
It's an easy way to backup your work and it's how you'll turn it in.

Once it begins around week 9, the tone of the class will shift from being a classroom setting, to more of a co-working space with me and each other as a resource.
