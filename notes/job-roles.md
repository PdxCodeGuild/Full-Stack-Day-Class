# Development Roles

Most mid to large size web companies have specialization in the skills of their developers.

Some companies are horizontally integrated: teams are organized by skill and are "loaned out" for product projects.
Some companies are vertically integrated: teams are organized by product or type and have a spectrum of development types within.

## Web Front-End

Deals with making the HTML and CSS and JS of the site.
Work with product managers and designers to come up and implement the visual.
Implement interactive JS components and will write templating and view code.

## Web Back-End

Deals with making the business logic / DB-interacting part of the site.
Work with product managers to learn product requirements and write an interface for the front-end developers to use to "do" the app.
Implement logic and data models.

## Web Full-Stack

Combination of front-end and back-end.

## Mobile Developer

Most web sites have a mobile app too, these days.
Like a web front-end developer, but writes iOS or Android code instead of HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Infrastructure

Deals with writing re-usable and performant framework, database, or logging tools for other developers to use.
Like a back-end's back-end.
Might develop specialized search engine technology or tools to link datastores and databases or develop front-end frameworks or work on an analytics pipeline to calculate usage metrics for the site.

## Operations / Ops

Deals with making sure the website is available and speedy.
Manages production servers and monitors them for issues.
Develops code to assist in running servers in the organization; every organization is slightly different so requires custom code.
Industry is moving in the direction of Ops folks just writing tooling and actually delegating management to core developers.

Often times is "on call" and might have to wake up at 3 A.M. if computers catch on fire.
Being on call is now often delegated to other developers.

## Developer Operations / DevOps

Deals with writing tools for other developers to be productive.
Writes source code, code review, testing, staging environment, and production deployment tooling.

## Database Administrator / DBA

Deals with making sure the database used is performant.
Helps other developers with interacting with the database in a reasonable way.
Often not a expert in programming, but an expert in DB design and SQL and use.

## Security

Deals with keeping the site secure.
Comes up with tooling and conventions to prevent other developers from introducing security issues.

## Quality Assurance / QA

Usually not considered a development role.
Some companies have separate departments tasked with testing software.
They write tests, setup test automation suites, do analysis of performance, report to developers what is working and not.

Many "legacy" tech companies have QA departments, but they are falling out of style for developer-driven testing.

## Product Manager / PM

Not a development role, but so closely related, I'll mention it here.
Deals with planning and design of the features of the web product.
Will prioritize features vs debugging vs refactoring for developers.
Has a give-and-take with them about what features are worthwhile vs easy to implement.

Although a "manager", usually is not technically the manager of developers.

## Designer

Not a development role, but can be technical.
Tasked with designing the visual appearance and sometimes functionality of the product.
Usually knows CSS and HTML well in order to prototype out things and understand what works for developers.
Works closely with PMs and front-end developers.

## User Interaction / UX Designer

Not a development role, but can be technical.
Subset of designer that is specifically tasked with planning out the ways users interact with the product.
Works closely with PMs and front-end developers.

## Engineering Manager

Technical manager of developers.
Does all the usual manager stuff: 1-1s, performance reviews, etc.

## Data Scientist

Usually not a proper development role.
Does ad-hoc programming and analysis for PMs and business folks.
Sometimes is in the pursuit of new product features, sometimes is just for company planning.
Works closely with infrastructure or backend engineers to get data or produce a product.
