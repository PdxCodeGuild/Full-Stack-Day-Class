# Practice: 21
Let's give basic Blackjack playing advice.

Ask the user for two playing cards;
either a number 2-10 or J, Q, K, A.

Using Blackjack scoring, if they add up to:
* Less than 21, print "Hit"
* Exactly 21, print "21"
* Over 21, print "Bust"

> What's your first card?
> Q
> What's your second card?
> 5
> Bust
