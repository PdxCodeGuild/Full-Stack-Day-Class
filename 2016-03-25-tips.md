# Tips: 2016-03-25
## Avoid Reference Dictionaries Directly
If you put a dictionary as the collection for a `for`-loop, it iterates over the _keys_:
```python
names_to_ages = {
  'David': 99,
  'Mel': 32
}
for name in names_to_ages:
  print('I know {}\'s age!'.format(name))
```

_Avoid_ referencing a bare dictionary as a collection.
Instead explicitly call `dict.keys()`.
It's better to have code that reminds you exactly what it's doing than to forget.

Better:
```python
names_to_ages = {
  'David': 99,
  'Mel': 32
}
for name in names_to_ages.keys():
  print('I know {}\'s age!'.format(name))
```

Same with sorting, and other collection functions.
Fine:
```python
max(names_to_ages, key=names_to_ages.get)
```

Better:
```python
max(names_to_ages.keys(), key=names_to_ages.get)
```

## Most Functions Return
Most type methods are like `str.lower()`, they return a modified version of the data structure:
```python
word = 'HellO'
lower_word = word.lower()  # 'hello'
# Note that word is unmodified.
```

Mutable collection methods are the _exception_:
```python
names = ['Helen', 'Kyle']
names.append('David')  # Returns nothing.
# Names is modified in place to ['Helen', 'Kyle', 'David']
```

## Variables Are Cheap
Variables are cheap!
Make a new, well-named variable for each transformation step.

Fine:
```python
def normalize(word):
  word = word.strip(' .,?!')
  word = word.lower()
  return word
```

Better:
```python
def normalize(word):
  word_without_punct = word.strip(' .,?!')
  lower_word_without_punct = word_without_punct.lower()
  return lower_word_without_punct
```
