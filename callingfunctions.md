# Calling Functions
Operators are the super basic verbs of programming represented by symbols.
But there are only so many symbols.

**Functions** give a name to a set of instructions that transform multiple input arguments to a single return value.

```
value -\
value --+- function --> value
value -/
```

Python gives us a function called `max`.
It returns the bigger of the two input arguments.

To use a function, you **call** it:
```python
max(5, 9)  #> 9
```


A function call is also an expression, and thus interchangeable with all other expressions:
```python

```
