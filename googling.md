# Googling for Solutions
Before asking me for help, you should search the internet on your own for help.
People have asked and answered many questions on the internet already.

1. Think of an English description of your problem.
1. Add "python" to the beginning.

Examples:

> python sorting a dictionary by value

> python interleaving two lists

> python picking out last item

> python join list of ints by comma

This is a skill to practice, just like coding.
