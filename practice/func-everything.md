# Practice: Refactor Everything

Save your solutions over your existing Python files in a branch named `func-everything` and create a pull request on GitHub for that branch.

Convert all the rest of your practice problems to use functions.

Break each step into a separate function with explicit input arguments and output return value, use a main which pipes data through all of the steps, and properly name functions.

If you find a better way to structure your code through this process, please use it!
No need to keep exactly the same solution steps as before.
