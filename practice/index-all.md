# Practice: Index All

Save your solution in `index-all.py`.

Python lists provide you with the `list.index(x[, start])` function.
It finds the _first_ occurrence of `x` in the list after the start index.
Write a function `index_all(l, x)` that returns a list of all of the indices that are equal to `x`.
