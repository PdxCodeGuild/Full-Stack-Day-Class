# Practice: Test Case Conversion

Write test cases for the steps / functions in your [case conversion](/practice/case.md) practice problem.

* Create a test module called `case_test.py`.
* Import your case change program, probably called `case.py`.
* Update your case test program to use `if __name__ == '__main__':` to prevent any code from running when the test module is run.
* Create a test case class called `CaseTest` in the test module.
* Write a test for your snake case to camel case function.
* Run the test via PyCharm's testing run config.

## Advanced
* Test all of the other transformation functions you wrote as part of the original problem.
