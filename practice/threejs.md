# Practice: three.js

Save your solution in a directory in `practice/` in a branch named `three`.
Your HTML file should be named `index.html`, your CSS file named `site.css`, and your JS file named `site.js` in that directory.

Using the WebGL library [three.js](http://threejs.org/), render a lit cube that can be spun using the mouse.
