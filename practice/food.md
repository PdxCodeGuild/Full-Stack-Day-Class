# Practice: Food Preferences
Create a new web page with a form that solicits people's feedback on their dinner yesterday.

Provide:
* A text box for single line description of what they ate dinner.
* A selection of checkboxes for "meat", "potatoes", "broccoli", "cheese" and have them select if any of them were eaten.
* A radio button where they can select if they were vegetarian or non.
* A drop-down menu of ice cream flavors and have them select their favorite.
* A free-form text field where they can talk about their most memorable dinner ever.
* A button to press if they're hungry.
* A button to submit.
