# Practice: Whack-A-Mole

Save your solution in a directory in `practice/` in a branch and make a GitHub pull request all named `mole`.
Your HTML file should be named `index.html`, your CSS file named `site.css`, and your JS file named `site.js` in that directory.

Make a 5x4 grid of hole images.
Every second, randomly pick a hole in the grid and turn it's image into a mole.
If the user clicks on a mole image, turn it back into a hole.

Use the [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval) function to run a callback function periodically.
