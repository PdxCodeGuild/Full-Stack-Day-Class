# Practice: Whack-A-Mole
Make a 5x4 grid of hole images.
Every second, randomly pick a hole in the grid and turn it's image into a mole.
If the user clicks on a mole image, turn it back into a hole.

Use the [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval) function to run a callback function periodically.
