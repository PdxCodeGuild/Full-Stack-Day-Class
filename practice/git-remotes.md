# Practice: Git Remotes

1.  Create a portfolio repo on GitHub named `codeguild`.
    Ensure that you don't initialize it with a readme or license or gitignore.

1.  Add it as a remote to your local repo.
    Use the instructions on the empty GitHub repo page.

1.  Make a trivial change to your source, commit it locally, then push it.
