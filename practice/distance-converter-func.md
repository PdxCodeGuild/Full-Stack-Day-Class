# Practice: Distance Converter Refactor

Save your solution over your existing `practice/distance-converter.py`.

Convert your [Distance Converter Practice](/practice/distance-converter.md) to use functions.

Break each step into a separate function with explicit input arguments and output return value, use a main which pipes data through all of the steps, and properly name functions.

If you find a better way to structure your code through this process, please use it!
No need to keep exactly the same solution steps as before.
