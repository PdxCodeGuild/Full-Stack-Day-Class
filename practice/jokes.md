# Practice: Jokes

Save your solution in a Django app, directory in `practice/`, in a branch, and in a Pull Request all named `jokes`.
This means there will be a directory `~/codeguild/practice/jokes/jokes`.

Have a page to submit jokes via a form.
A joke has a "setup" and a "punchline" input.
Submitted jokes should be saved in a global array in your models module.

Have a listing page where jokes are shown.
Initially hide all of the punch lines.
Then when someone clicks on the setup for a joke, reveal the punchline of just that joke.
