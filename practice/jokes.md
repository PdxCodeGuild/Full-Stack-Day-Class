# Practice: Jokes

Save your solution as `jokes`.

Have a page to submit jokes via a form.
A joke has a "setup" and a "punchline" input.
Submitted jokes should be saved in a global array in your logic module.

Have a listing page where jokes are shown.
Initially hide all of the punch lines.
Then when someone clicks on the setup for a joke, reveal the punchline of just that joke.

## Advanced

Ensure that the jokes aren't empty before accepting the submission.
Use AJAX to submit your jokes.
