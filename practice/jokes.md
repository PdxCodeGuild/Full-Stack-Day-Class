# Practice: Jokes
Save your solution as `jokes`.

Have a page to submit jokes via a form.
A joke has a "setup" and a "punchline" input.
Submitted jokes should be saved in a global array in your logic module.

Have a listing page where jokes are shown.
Hide the punch lines until someone clicks on the setup.

## Advanced
Ensure that the jokes aren't empty before accepting the submission.
Use AJAX to submit your jokes.
