# Practice: I-E Spelling

Save your solution in a Python file in `practice/` in a branch and make a GitHub pull request all named `spelling`.

Create a program asks for a _single_ English word and checks if it follows the rule "I before E except after C".
Then print out the input word and if it follows the rule, like the example below.

Try to search for the index of any instances of `ie` in the string, then see if the preceding letter is `c`.

> Word? believe
>
> believe does follow the rule
>
> Word? ceiling
>
> ceiling does follow the rule
>
> Word? science
>
> science doesn't follow the rule
>
> Word? weird
>
> weird doesn't follow the rule
