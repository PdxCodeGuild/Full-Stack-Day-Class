# Practice: Color

Save your solution in a directory in `practice/` named `color`.
Your HTML file should be named `index.html` and your JS file named `site.js` in that directory.

Make a `Color` type.
Implement a `Color(r, g, b)` constructor where the values are between 0 and 255.
Implement the following prototype methods:

* `blend(other)` that returns a new color half way between the two
* `toHex()` that returns the CSS hex code as a string of the color like `#FF13C9`
