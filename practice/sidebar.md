# Practice: Sidebar

Save your solution in a directory in `practice/` named `sidebar`.
Your HTML file should be named `index.html` and your CSS file named `site.css` in that directory.

Recreate the following sample layout using just flexboxes.

![Sidebar Layout](/practice/sidebar.jpeg)

*   A sidebar that is 30% of the page width, with:

    * A site title
    * A vertical list of nav links
    * Don't worry about making the sidebar full height or a different background color

*   A main page taking up the rest of the width, with:

    * A page title
    * A large image taking up the full width
    * Three small paragraphs aligned under the image taking up the full width
    * Two full-width paragraphs after that
    * Reasonable spacing between all of these elements

You can fill in whatever example text and splash graphic you want.
