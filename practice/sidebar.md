# Practice: Sidebar
Save your solution as `sidebar.html` and `sidebar.css`.

Recreate the following sample layout.

![Sidebar Layout](https://designshack.net/wp-content/uploads/layoutideas-6-1.jpg)

* A sidebar that is 20% of the page width, with:
    * A site title
    * A vertical list of nav links
    * Don't worry about making the sidebar full height or a different background color
* A main page taking up the rest of the width, with:
    * A page title
    * A large image taking up the full width
    * Three small paragraphs aligned under the image taking up the full width
    * A full-width paragraph after that
    * Reasonable spacing between all of these elements

You can fill in whatever example text and splash graphic you want.
