# Practice: Site Metrics

Save your solution in a Python file in `practice/` in a branch and make a GitHub pull request all named `site-metrics`.

Most web apps keep meticulous logs of all interactions users have with the site.

* Searches performed
* Estimate of page view duration
* Referrers to a page

This allows the developers and product managers at a company to get insight into how the different parts of the site are engaging and helping users without directly asking them.

Let's say you're developing the product search feature of a shopping site like Amazon.
