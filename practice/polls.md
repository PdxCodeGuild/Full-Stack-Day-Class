# Practice: Polls
Save your solution in a `polls` directory.

Have a site with two pages:
1. Poll submission
1. Summary

On the poll submission page ask people what their favorite color of ice cream is:
* Chocolate
* Vanilla
* Strawberry

On the summary page, have a table of responses and percentages.

## Advanced
* Submit the polls using AJAX
* Combine the submission and summary page and have the summary page dynamically re-query the server for the new summary after the new poll was submitted
