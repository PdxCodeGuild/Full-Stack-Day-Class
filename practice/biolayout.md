# Practice: Bio Layout
Keep your bio's HTML as `bio.html` and enhance your style sheet already in `bio.css`.

Let's practice using layout in your bio:
* Center the entire content of the body; use a [flexbox](/notes/flexbox.md).
* Add / pick an existing image in one of the sections and float it.
* Modify the padding and margins on your paragraphs to look better.

## Advanced
* Try out using [media queries](http://learnlayout.com/media-queries.html) to have the layout change on small screens / phones.
