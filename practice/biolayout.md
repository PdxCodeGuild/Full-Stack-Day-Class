# Practice: Bio Layout
Keep your bio's HTML as `bio.html` and enhance your style sheet already in `bio.css`.

Let's practice using layout in your bio:
* Center the entire content of the body; use the [auto margins](/notes/automargins.md) trick.
* Add / pick an existing image in one of the sections and float it.
* Modify the padding and margins on your paragraphs to look better.
