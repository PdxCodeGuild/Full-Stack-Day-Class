# Practice: 21

Save your solution as `practice/21.py`.

Let's give basic Blackjack playing advice.

First, ask the user for two playing cards.
Save the user's inputs as a _string_: A, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, or K.

Then, figure out the point value of each card individually.
Number cards are worth their number, all face cards are worth 10.
At this point, assume aces are worth 1.

Now, in Blackjack, aces can be worth 11 if they won't put the total point value of both cards over 21.

Lastly, figure out what the playing advice will be.

* Less than 17, advise to "Hit"
* Over or equal to 17, advise to "Stay"
* Exactly 21, advise "Blackjack!"

Then print out the current total point value and the advice.

> What's your first card?
> Q
> What's your second card?
> 5
> 15 Hit
>
> What's your first card?
> K
> What's your second card?
> J
> 20 Stay
>
> What's your first card?
> A
> What's your second card?
> J
> 21 Blackjack!

This code will be pretty repetitive, but straightforward.
