# Practice: Image Serve
Save your solution as `image_serve`.

You're going to make a basic image server.
It will convert an image into different formats.

1. Make a page to upload an image.
1. Serve that image at `/image`.
1. Also serve the image at `/image.EXT`.
Use Pillow to open the image and convert it.
