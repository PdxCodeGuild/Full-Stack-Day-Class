# Practice: Multi-Madlib
Make a website that fills in madlibs.
Find or make up three madlibs with three slots each.

Make a view for each madlib.
Have it take in query arguments for each slot.
If any query arguments are missing, respond with a 400 and a list of the needed argument names in the body.
Otherwise, respond with a 200 and the filled out madlib.
