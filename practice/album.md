# Practice: Picture Album
Save your solution as `album.html`, `album.css`, and `album.js`.

* Give the user a text box that they can enter image URLs into.
* When the user clicks "submit", that image will be added and displayed in an album below.
* Each album image will appear in it's own "tile".
* Each album tile will have a 300 pixels by 300 pixels instance of the image (just fix these, I don't care if the image is squashed) and underneath will be a link to the original image URL and a button to delete the image from the album.
* Layout the tiles in a grid.
* Have a header above the album that displays the total number of images saved.
