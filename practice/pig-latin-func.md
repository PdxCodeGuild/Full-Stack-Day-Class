# Practice: Pig Latin Refactor

Save your solution over your existing `practice/pig-latin.py` in a branch named `pig-latin-func` and create a pull request on GitHub for that branch.

Convert your [Pig Latin Practice](/practice/pig-latin.md) to use functions.

Break each step into a separate function with explicit input arguments and output return value, use a main which pipes data through all of the steps, and properly name functions.

If you find a better way to structure your code through this process, please use it!
No need to keep exactly the same solution steps as before.
