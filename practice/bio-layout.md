# Practice: Bio Layout

Save your solution in `practice/bio`.
Add to your existing `site.css`.

Also finish all of the requirements of the [original problem](/practice/bio.md) and the [style problem](/practice/bio-style.md).

Let's practice using layout in your bio:
* Center the entire content of the body; use a [flexbox](/notes/flexbox.md).
* Add / pick an existing image in one of the sections and float it.
* Modify the padding and margins on your paragraphs to look better.
* Add a short multi-column section using flexboxes.

## Advanced
* Try out using [media queries](http://learnlayout.com/media-queries.html) to have the layout change on small screens / phones.
