# Practice: Bio Layout

Also finish all of the requirements of the [original problem](/practice/bio.md) and the [style problem](/practice/bio-style.md).

Let's practice using [flexbox](/notes/layout-flexbox.md) layout in your bio:

* Center the entire content of the body
* Add / pick an existing image in one of the sections and float it
* Modify the padding and margins on your paragraphs to look better
* Add a short multi-column section using flexboxes

## Advanced

* Try out using [media queries](http://learnlayout.com/media-queries.html) to have the layout change on small screens / phones.
