# Practice: Bio Style
Keep your bio's HTML as `bio.html` and save the style sheet as `bio.css`.

Let's vamp up your bio.
Using only an external stylesheet, add the following stylistic features:
* Pick a color scheme and modify the background, body text, and link text color
* Change the typeface of the quote
* Add a rounded border to the picture
* Change the bullet points on the list of places to be the gaudy `â˜ž`
