# Practice: Wall Painting
Save your solution as `wallpainting.py`.

All our friends are re-painting one wall of their rooms.
They want us to figure out how much it's going to cost.

Ask the user for:
1. Width of the wall.
1. Height of the wall.
1. How much a gallon of paint costs.

Assume one gallon of paint covers 400 square feet.

* Figure out and print how much it will cost to paint the wall with one coat.
* Also ask the user for how many coats they're going to put on, and calculate that cost.

## Advanced
* Allow the user to enter multiple wall dimensions and it adds the total areas together before calculating the cost.
