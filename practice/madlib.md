# Practice: Madlib
Save your solution as `madlib.py`.

Make a simple madlib filling program.
Use the madlib:
> The NOUN jumped over the ADJ NOUN.

Prompt the user to input those three placeholder words, save them in variables, interpolate them into the madlib, then print the final madlib.

## Advanced
* Look up or make up a more complicated madlib and fill that out.
