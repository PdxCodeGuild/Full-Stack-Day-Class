# Practice: Madlib

Save your solution as `practice/madlib.py`.

Make a simple madlib filling program.
Use the madlib:

> The NOUN jumped over the ADJ NOUN.

Prompt the user to input those three placeholder words, save them in variables, interpolate them into the madlib, then print the final madlib.

## Advanced

* Look up or make up a more complicated madlib and fill that out.

## Super Advanced

Make a flexible madlib parser for any length madlib.

* Read a madlib from a text file that has the special text `{noun}` for each placeholder.
* Ask the user for a real word for each placeholder.
* Then fill in those words and print out the final madlib.
