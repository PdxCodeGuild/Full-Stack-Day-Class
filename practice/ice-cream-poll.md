# Practice: Ice Cream Poll

Save your solution in a Django app, directory in `practice/`, and in a branch all named `ice_cream_poll`.
This means there will be a directory `~/codeguild/practice/ice_cream_poll/ice_cream_poll`.

Have a site with three pages:

1. Poll submission
1. Submission acknowledgement
1. Summary

On the poll submission page ask people what their favorite flavor of ice cream is:

* Chocolate
* Vanilla
* Strawberry

On the summary page, have a table of flavors and percentages.
If a flavor has never been voted for, give it a 0%.
