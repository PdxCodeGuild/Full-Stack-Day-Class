# Practice: Bus Stop Finder
Using the [Web Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation) and the [TriMet Web Services API](http://developer.trimet.org/ws_docs/), write a web page that, when loaded, gives you a list of all of the bus lines that have stops within 100 meters of your current location.
Then provide a link for each bus line to it's map (e.g. [line 14 map](http://trimet.org/schedules/r014.htm)).

I have intentionally not taught you the specifics of these two APIs.
I have taught you about all the necessary concepts, though.
Look up what functions they provide, what format responses come in, and figure out how to implement.
