# Practice: Bus Stop Finder

Save your solution in a directory in `practice/` in a branch named `bus-stop`.
Your HTML file should be named `index.html`, your CSS file named `site.css`, and your JS file named `site.js` in that directory.
Any keys should live in a `secrets.js`.

Using the [Web Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation) and the [TriMet Web Services API](http://developer.trimet.org/ws_docs/), write a web page that, when loaded, gives you a list of all of the bus lines that have stops within 100 meters of your current location.
Then provide a link for each bus line to it's map (e.g. [line 14 map](http://trimet.org/schedules/r014.htm)).

## Advanced

Add a Google Map that visually displays markers for each stop nearby.
