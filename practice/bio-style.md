# Practice: Bio Style

Save your solution in `practice/bio`.
Alongside your existing `index.html`, add `site.css`.

Also finish all of the requirements of the [original problem](/practice/bio.md).

Let's vamp up your bio.
Using only an external stylesheet, add the following stylistic features:
* Pick a color scheme and modify the background, body text, and link text color.
* Change the typeface of the quote.
* Add a rounded border to the picture.
* Change the bullet points on the list of places to be the gaudy  character `☞`.
Literally copy and paste that character from this problem into your CSS.
