# Practice: Bio Style

Update your `bio` directory in `practice/` in a branch and make a GitHub pull request both named `bio-style`.
Your CSS file should be named `site.css` in the `bio` directory alongside `index.html`.

First, ensure you've finish all of the basic requirements of the [original problem](/practice/bio.md).

Now, let's vamp up your bio.
In an external stylesheet, add the following stylistic features:

*   Pick a color scheme and modify the background, body text, and link text color.

*   Change the typeface of the quote.

*   Add a rounded border to the picture.

*   Change the bullet points on the list of places to be the gaudy character `â˜ž`.
    Literally copy and paste that character from this problem into your CSS.

If you need to edit the HTML file to add classes or IDs, that's fine.
