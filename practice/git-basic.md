# Practice: Basic Git

1. Turn your `~/codeguild` directory into a Git repo, if you haven't already.
1. Create a portfolio repo on GitHub named `codeguild`.
1. Add it as a remote to your local repo.
1. Create a Git ignore file and fill it with my example ignore rules.
1. Add and commit that ignore file.
Check the repo's status after each step.
1. Add and commit each Python file you've worked on thus far each in _their own commit_.
Check the status of the index after each step to ensure you're doing that.
1. After each commit, push and check the log to see your commits being added.
