# Practice: Basic Git

1.  Turn your `~/codeguild` directory into a Git repo, if you haven't already.

1.  Add and commit each Python file you've worked on thus far each in _their own commit_.
    Check the status of the index and log after each step to ensure you're doing that.

1.  Create a Git ignore file and fill it with my example ignore rules.

1.  Add and commit that ignore file.
    Check the repo's status after each step.
