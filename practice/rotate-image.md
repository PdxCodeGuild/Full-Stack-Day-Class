# Practice: Rotate Image

Pillow is a Python package for working with images.
Create a full [Python application](/notes/py-app-structure.md) that has a [virtualenv](/notes/py-virtualenv.md) with Pillow installed in it.
Save your application in a `rotate_image` directory.

Then create a program named `rotate_image.py` in your application that uses Pillow to open an image, rotate it 45 degrees, and save the rotated version as `rotated.png`.
Check out the [Pillow docs](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/) and search around on the internet.

It's okay that there's an inner `.gitignore`.
When you're done with it, let me know and I'll ask you some questions about using the virutalenv and running your program.
