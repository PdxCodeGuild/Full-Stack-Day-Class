# Practice: Rotate Image

Save your solution in a directory in `practice/` in a branch and make a GitHub pull request all named `rotate`.

[Pillow](https://python-pillow.org) is a Python package for working with images.
Create a full [Python application](/notes/py-app-structure.md) that has a [virtualenv](/notes/py-virtualenv.md) with Pillow installed in it.

Create a program `rotate.py` in your application that uses Pillow to open an image, rotate it 45 degrees, and save the rotated version.
Have it take in the input image and output image filename from the command line arguments of the script.

```bash
python rotate.py input.jpg rotated.png
```

Check out the [Pillow docs](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/) and search around on the internet for help on opening, rotating, and saving images.
Still practice good program structure, even for this little demo.

When you're done with it, let me know and I'll ask you some questions about using the virutalenv and running your program via PyCharm and the CLI.
