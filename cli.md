# Command Line Interface
We're going to learn a new interface to our computer.
No icons, no menus, just **text**.

The computer outputs appends new text to a history of output.
You can type and supply new text as input.

Why?

* Efficient -
Direct action.
Once you know the command you want, just type it.
Steep learning curve, though.

* Simple -
Our programs must communicate with a human;
let's use the simplest interface, so we can focus on the problem.

* Composable -
When text is both input and output, we can string together programs.

* Tooling -
Tools built for the command line over 40 years!
Often, your problem has already been solved.
