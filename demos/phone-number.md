# Demo: Phone Numbers

Write a small app that asks the user for an all-digits ten or seven digit phone number.
Then pretty prints it out in both `XXX-XXX-XXXX` and `(XXX) XXX-XXXX` format.
If there isn't an area code, drop that part.

> Phone number? All digits. 5035551234
>
> 503-555-1234
>
> (503) 555-1234
>
> Phone number? All digits. 5551234
>
> 555-1234
>
> 555-1234
