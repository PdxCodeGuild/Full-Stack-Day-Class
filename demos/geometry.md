# Demo: Geometry
I've been tasked with helping write a program that can store and manipulate rectangles and points.

The other person who's writing the program wants to be able to:
* Find the distance between two points.
* Know if a point is inside a rectangle.
* Find the center point of a rectangle.
* Know if two points or rectangles are the same.
* Move a point by a specified amount.
