# Demo: Comments

Make a component where people can post comments.

Have a posting page.
A posting is some comment text and an author.
A comment should be rejected if either of the fields are empty.

Have a listing page with all of the comments posted thus far.
Allow the listing page to filter to just comments posted by a single author.
