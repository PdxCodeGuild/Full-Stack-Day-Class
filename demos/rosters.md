# Demo: Rosters

PDX Code Guild wants you to write a program that will store all of our class rosters.
The roster will be a list of students and the name of the instructor.
We need to store each student's name and email address.

The program will send out an introductory email to everyone introducing the instructor and telling everyone how many students are in the class.
