# Demo: Highlight

Make a tiny web-app that you can put in source code into a text box and press submit and without reloading the page show a syntax-highlighted version of the source code and what language it is.

Use the [Pygments](http://pygments.org) language detection and syntax highlighting library to accomplish this.
