# Demo: Written-Out Numbers Refactor

Convert the [Written-Out Numbers Demo](/demos/written-numbers.md) to use functions.

Break each step into a separate function with explicit input arguments and output return value, use a main which pipes data through all of the steps, and properly name functions.

If you find a better way to structure your code through this process, please use it!
No need to keep exactly the same solution steps as before.
