# Demo: Leet Speak

Create a program that converts a sentence of English to a sentence of "leet speak", the internet dialect.
Various characters are replaced:

* `o` -> `0`
* `l` -> `1`
* `e` -> `3`
* `a` -> `4`
* `t` -> `7`
* `s` -> `Z` only at the end of a word

Also wrap the words in parentheses.

For the input:

```
fathers brought forth on this continent
```

Would result in:

```
(f47h3rZ) (br0ugh7) (f0r7h) (0n) (7hiZ) (c0n7in3n7)
```
